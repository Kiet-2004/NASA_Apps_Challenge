  "title": "Characterization of mouse ocular response to a 35-day spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations",
  "abstract": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nAstronaut health and safety are of key importance to the success of long-term missions in space. More than 50% of the astronauts returning from space shuttle missions or the International Space Station (ISS) have reported a subjective change in their visual acuity. The underlying mechanisms and pathological manifestations of increased vision impairment during and after spaceflight is currently unknown. Various factors have been suggested to account for these disturbances, including increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Modeling studies have shown that a compromise in the integrity of the cerebrovascular barrier function would serve to elevate ICP. Similar to how the blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions in the cranium, the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is an endothelial barrier which regulates vascular permeability and maintains intraocular pressure (IOP). Little work has been done to examine retinal structure and BRB integrity/function following prolonged exposure to spaceflight in animal models.\n\nSpaceflight has been reported to have numerous negative effects on ocular and structure and function. However, data on how spaceflight impacts protein expression in the retina are limited. We have previously evaluated ocular tissue responses obtained from mice flown to and from the ISS on both the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) as well as the SpaceX-9 Dragon rocket. Although numerous differences were noted in the flight mice compared to control animals on ground, an intriguing finding especially relevant to the present study was that spaceflight conditions induced significant changes in protein expression related to endothelial apoptosis, inflammation and metabolic function in the retina.\n\nThe goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on retinal vascular alterations and BRB integrity, and to identify changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue following spaceflight using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and a proteomics approach.",
  "methods": "Material and Methods\n\nFlight and control conditions\n\nOn August 14, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) which included 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were kept equivalent to that of FLT mice based on 48 h delayed telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same reformulated rodent food bar diet approved by NASA as the space flown mice. Consumption of food and water was monitored daily throughout this study.\n\nAnimal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and activities involving vertebrate animals are carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nDue to Hurricane Irma’s impact on KSC in September, 2017, experiments with both GC and GV control groups were cancelled and later rescheduled for May, 2018, using mice of the same strain, sex, age and animals were from the same holding room from the vendor that were used for the flight experiments. This resulted in a large time gap between tissue collection for the flight and KSC ground control groups. Consequently, the FV cohort-matched control group was added to the study to help control for possible differences associated with this delay. Tissue collection with the FV group were conducted several days after studies with the FLT animals were concluded. Table 2 details the groups, housing conditions and mouse bodyweights for this study.\n\nPost-flight evaluation of the mice\n\nUpon return to the Earth, mice were transported to LLU within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. The inspecting personnel reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized.\n\nIOP measurement\n\nBefore launch and again before the post-flight euthanization, a handheld tonometer (TonoLab-ICARE, Raleigh, NC) was used to measure IOP in conscious animals. This allowed IOP to be measured accurately, rapidly and without a local anesthetic. Measurements of IOP using the rebound tonometer appeared to be well tolerated by the mice. The animals exhibited no signs of irritation or discomfort during the procedure. Five-6 sequential measurements were made to obtain an average of the counts as a single IOP readout for each mouse. This process was repeated three times for each eye.\n\nEye and retina preparation after spaceflight\n\nThe mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 and eyes were collected within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown (n = 20/group). The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes from 2 experimental groups: GC and FLT were dissected to obtain the retina, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for proteomics analysis.\n\nTUNEL assay\n\nThe ocular sections were evaluated using the TUNEL assay according to standard procedures. Data were obtained for 6 ocular samples of each group. Briefly, six μm paraffin embedded sections were processed using DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (Catalog No. G3250, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue, Life Technologies, Eugene, Oregon). Six to 10 field images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina per section.\n\nImmunohistochemistry for AQP-4 and vascular double-labeling\n\nSix μm sections were incubated overnight (18–21 hours) at 4 °C with primary antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-AQP-4 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX) and monoclonal mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) clone GA5 (1:1000, Millipore, Burlington, MA) in 0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. Sections were washed 3 times in PBS and further treated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 Goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Life Technologies). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and sections were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield Hard-Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Six to 10 field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections.\n\nImmunostaining assays for PECAM-1 and ZO-1\n\nImmunofluorescence staining related to BRB integrity on ocular sections was performed using biomarkers against PECAM-1 and ZO-1. Six µm sections were deparaffinized in Histoclear, rehydrated and washed in PBS for 20 minutes. For enzymatic antigen retrieval, sections were incubated in 1 mg/ml Actinase E (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS for 20 minutes at 37 °C, rinsed in running tap water for 3 minutes and washed in PBS for 5 minutes. Sections were then blocked in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Vasculature was labeled with DyLight® 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (1:100, Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by 10 minutes wash in PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit antibodies against ZO-1 (1:50) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) or CD31/PECAM-1 (1:100) (Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO) in antibody dilution buffer (0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS). After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1.5 hours with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (1:1000 in antibody dilution buffer; Life Technologies) followed by PBS washes. The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI solution (1 µg/ml in PBS; Life Technologies) washed in PBS and coverslipped with Vectashield® HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Six to 10 field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections.\n\nQuantification of Immunostaining\n\nFor quantitative analysis, numbers of TUNEL positive cells and TUNEL positive endothelial cells were counted separately. The total number of TUNEL-positive nuclear /ganglion cells or endothelial cells in the retina were counted in 5 sections from each eye. The surface of each section was measured on digital microphotographs using ImageJ v1.4 software (available as freeware from National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), and the density profiles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value.\n\nTo determine AQP4, ZO-1 and PECAM immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 6 to 10 randomly selected fields on each section and calculated using ImageJ software. Fluorescence intensities for positive cells (red channel for ZO-1 and PECAM, and green channel for AQP-4) from the areas of interest were measured and data were extracted and averaged across 5 retina sections per eye within the group.\n\nProteomics analysis\n\nA total of 12 frozen retinas from 2 experimental groups (GC and FLT, n = 6 mice per group) were shipped to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences for proteomics analysis.\n\nProtein lysates were prepared and 20 μg of protein lysate were resolved in a 4–20% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The gel was cut into 12 thick gel slices (2 mm thick) for each sample and an in-gel trypsin digestion was performed as previously described in (Mao et al. 2018). Briefly, gel slices were destained in 50% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 100 mM. Once destained, the proteins were reduced in 10 mM Tris [2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (Pierce, Dallas, TX) and alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel slices were prepared for trypsin digestion by dehydrating in acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An overnight trypsin digestion was performed by the addition of 100 ng porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 37 °C for 12–16 hours. Peptide products were then acidified in 0.1% formic acid (Pierce Corp.) to stop the trypsin reaction. Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase Jupiter Proteo resin (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) on a 200 × 0.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were eluted using a 30 minute gradient from 97:3 to 65:35 buffer A: B ratio. [Buffer A = 0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile; buffer B = 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile.] The peptide eluents were ionized by electrospray (2.15 kV), MS1 peptides were detected and subjected to MS/MS analysis using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Corp.) in top-speed data-dependent mode. MS data were acquired using the FTMS analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 240,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 m/z. MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with precursor mass-dependent normalized collision energy between 28.0 and 31.0.\n\nBioinformatic analysis of proteomics data\n\nProteins were identified and quantified using MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16, Max Planck Institute). MS/MS spectra were submitted to MaxQuant for database searching using the UniProtKB database (2018-06 release; restricted to Mus musculus; 81,557 entries). MS1 iBAQ protein intensities were obtained by performing a MS1 reporter type database search with trypsin digestion including up to three missed cleavages. Modifications included both fixed modifications (carbamidomethyl of cysteine) and variable modifications (oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus). The first search was set to 5 ppm precursor ion tolerance for a search against a contaminants database in order to identify commonly identified contaminants, such as keratin proteins. The main search against the mouse database was set to 3 ppm. Label-free quantitation with iBAQ with a minimum ratio of 1 was selected to obtain the MS1 intensity values. Peptide and protein identifications were accepted using the 1.0% false discovery rate identification threshold.\n\nThe MaxQuant iBAQ values for each sample were median normalized so the medians were equal to the sample with the maximum median (sample FLT 5). Median normalized iBAQ intensities were then imported into Perseus (version 1.6.1.3, Max Planck Institute). Perseus was used to log2 transform the data and impute the missing values using a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2 standard deviations. Principal Component Analysis was performed on the normalized data set and a batch effect was detected among replicates due to sample processing (data not shown). The batch effect was corrected using the R function ComBat from the SVA Bioconductor package. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney u tests were used to compare the ground GC and FLT sample groups. The p-values were corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg to account for multiple testing. Fold changes were also calculated. Proteins that were significant by the FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and that had a fold change greater than 2 were considered to be differentially expressed. The heat maps were generated using the Bioconductor R package ComplexHeatmap with the Euclidean distance metric and the clustering method set to complete. Volcano plots were generated using R base function plot (R version 3.4.4). These significant proteins were then analyzed using IPA (QIAGEN Inc., Frederick, MD).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe results obtained from IOP measurements, TUNEL assay and IHC were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test for multiple pair-wise comparisons (Sigma Plot for Windows, version 13.0; Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA). Means and standard error of means (SEM) are reported. The statistical analysis of proteomics results is described above.",
  "results": "Results\n\nIOP measurement\n\nTukey’s post hoc comparison showed that IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg, p < 0.05) in the left eye of the flight (FLT) mice (Fig. 1A). However, there were no significant differences in IOP measurements in the right eye (Fig. 1B).\n\nApoptotic damage in the retina\n\nRepresentative images of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay were presented for FLT, habitat ground controls (GC) and vivarium control conditions, including both flight vivarium (FV) and ground vivarium (GV) control groups (Fig. 2A). Quantitative assessment indicated that the density of apoptotic cells in the retinal nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer (GCL) was significantly higher in the FLT group, and was 2–2.5 fold higher compared to that in the GC group (Fig. 2B). The number of TUNEL positive endothelial cells were also calculated (Fig. 2C). A significant increase of apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells was detected ranging from 1.6 to 2.0-fold for FLT group compared to ground and vivarium controls, respectively (p < 0.05).\n\nBRB integrity and endothelial proteins\n\nTwo astrocyte markers were used to examine the integrity of the BRB: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4). GFAP is present in the cell bodies and large processes of astrocytes. It is an intermediate filament protein involved in the maintenance of the BRB. (Fig. 3A). AQP-4 is a water channel protein concentrated at the luminal surfaces of astrocyte end-feet which clearly outline the vascular bed to which they adhere. In the retina, AQP4 is expressed in glia cells (astrocyte and Müller cells) and is responible for BRB integrity. Increased positive AQP4 staining (green) was seen in the retinal GCL and inner nuclear layer (INL) of the FLT group (Fig. 3A) compared with ground controls. As shown in Fig. 3B, the fluorescent intensity reflecting endogenous levels of AQP-4 in the retina was significantly greater in the FLT group compared with the GC group (p < 0.01). There was no signficant differences between three control groups; the average intensities were 36.9 +/− 3.0, 34.9 +/− 1.9 and 35.1 +/− 3.6 for the GC, GV and FV groups respectively. There was no notable difference in the pattern and instensity of GFAP staining.\n\nTo examine whether spaceflight alters cellular expression of the endothelial cell juction proteins and retinal barrier integrity, the eye tissue expression of the endothelial cell-cell adhesion molecule, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) and tight junction (TJ) proteins, such as Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were evaluated. In FLT mice, increased immunoreactivity for PECAM-1 (red) was predominantly present in GCL (Fig. 4A). PECAM-1 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in the FLT group compared to GC mice (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, ZO-1 expression (red) was detected at the GCL and the photorecepotor inner segment (IS) of the eye tissues (Fig. 5A). The level of ZO-1 immunoactivity tended to be lower (p = 0.062) in the FLT group compared to that in GC controls (Fig. 5B).\n\nProteomics analysis of mouse ocular tissues\n\nTwenty micrograms of protein from retina samples in the GC and FLT groups were resolved by 4–20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Tris-Gly gel electrophoresis, visualized by Coomassie stain, in-gel trypsin digested, and analyzed by LC/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer. A MaxQuant database search (restricted to Mus musculus) identified a total of 6,634 proteins from all 12 samples with 6,353 (96%) proteins identified in common among the GC and FLT samples (Fig. 6). MaxQuant iBAQ intensity values were median normalized, log2 transformed, and missing values were imputed based on the normal distribution using Perseus (version 1.5.6.0). Batch effects were corrected using the ComBat function from the sva bioconductor package. The log2 normalized iBAQ intensity values were used for statistical analysis. A Mann-Whitney U test was performed and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the FDR level.\n\nWe identified a total of 6,634 proteins of which 485 significantly differentiated in FLT compared to GC by FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 1). These proteins are shown as a heatmap using a hierarchical cluster of the log2 normalized iBAQ intensities for all samples (Fig. 7). The significant protein profile is able to clearly separate the two groups. This list was then reduced to 224 significant proteins when we included a fold change >2 cutoff (Supplementary Table 2). Volcano plots were generated to visualize all identified proteins and highlight significant proteins. The y-axis consists of −log10 p-values based on the Mann–Whitney U FDR adjusted p-values, while the x-axis consists of the log2 fold change. The vertical lines indicate up- and down expression using a fold change >2 threshold. The horizontal line indicates a p-value of 0.05 (Fig. 8). A total of 126 proteins were up-regulated while 98 proteins were down-regulated in FLT compared to GC. Ten most significantly increased and decreased protein expression levels related to cellular organization, cell cycle, apoptosis, circadian clock, neuronal and mitochondrial function are summarized and listed in Table 1. These differentially expressed proteins were then analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis). Pathways were considered significant based on the Fisher exact test with a −log10 p-value > 1.3 (corresponds to a p-value < 0.05). IPA revealed significant changes in pathways related to cell death, adhesion juction/tight junction signaling, calcium signaling, mitochondrial function and metabolism. Significantly affected canonical pathways between GC and FLT groups are shown in Fig. 9.",
