  "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nPrevious work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups (n = 10 each): CON‐VEH; CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; HLU‐VEH; and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A‐mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2×/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU‐VEH group (–5.3% ± 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc (–0.3% ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU‐VEH). Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc than CON‐VEH (10.2% ± 0.6% versus 4.4% ± 0.8%). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment for 3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups compared to comparable VEH‐treated counterparts (p < 0.05). HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc mice also had 21% greater failure load (p < 0.05) compared to their VEH‐treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFc led to significantly greater mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold higher bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated CON and HLU animals versus VEH groups, respectively. mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH‐treated animals in both the CON and HLU groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse‐induced bone loss. © 2017 The Authors JBMR Plus published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nMechanical loading is essential to skeletal health, because muscle and bone atrophy occur in the setting of disuse. This disuse osteoporosis results in bone loss rates of 1% to 2% per month at weight bearing sites in those exposed to prolonged periods of reduced mechanical loading, such as occurs with paralysis, bed rest during recovery from injury or illness, or spaceflight.1 Current treatments for prevention of disuse osteoporosis rely on anti‐resorptive agents that lower the rate of bone turnover, decreasing both resorption and formation over time. Further, although bisphosphonate therapy inhibits bone loss in astronauts2 and in patients with acute and chronic spinal cord injuries,3, 4, 5 there is limited evidence of increased BMD, as is normally seen in postmenopausal women treated with bisphosphonates.6 Thus, a treatment that not only inhibits bone resorption but also stimulates bone formation may be desirable in the setting of severe disuse. Intermittent parathyroid hormone, or teriparatide, is the only clinically available treatment that promotes bone formation. However, intermittent PTH therapy also induces bone resorption and in some cases transient hypercalcemia, both of which are undesirable in the setting of disuse, in which negative calcium balance and high calcium excretion are common.1, 7 Given the profound bone loss seen in disuse, treatments that promote bone formation while limiting resorption would be ideal.\n\nPrevious work demonstrates that a soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2/4 specifically and with high affinity.8 This in turn inhibits dickkopf‐1 (Dkk1) expression in osteoblasts to activate canonical Wnt signaling to promote bone formation. In addition, receptor activator of NF‐κB ligand (RANKL) expression in osteoblasts is reduced with the treatment, resulting in decreased bone resorption. Thus, treatment of normal and estrogen‐deficient mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced bone resorption.8 In this study, we aimed to test the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss using the murine hindlimb unloading model. We hypothesized that mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment would inhibit the bone loss seen in disuse through increased bone formation and reduced bone resorption compared to vehicle‐treated hindlimb unloaded (HLU) counterparts.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nOverview of study design\n\nUsing baseline body mass and total body BMD to minimize group differences, we assigned 12‐week‐old female C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) to one of two loading groups: HLU or control (CON), and one of two treatment groups: mBMPR1A‐mFc or vehicle (VEH), resulting in four experimental groups (n = 10 each): (i) CON‐VEH; (ii) CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; (iii) HLU‐VEH; and (iv) HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc. Mice were exposed to HLU via tail suspension for 21 days as described.9 Measurements of body weight and subcutaneous injections of vehicle or mBMPR1A‐mFc (4.5 mg/kg; Acceleron Pharma, Cambridge, MA, USA) occurred twice per week. Mice were maintained on a 12‐hour/12‐hour light/dark cycle, had ad libitum access to standard laboratory rodent chow and water, and were euthanized by CO2 inhalation at the end of the experiment. All animal procedures were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\nIn vivo BMD\n\nWe used peripheral dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (pDXA) (PIXImusII; GE Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA) to measure total body (excluding the head region) and hindlimb BMD (g/cm2) in vivo, as described.(9,10) Measurements were acquired at baseline and end of the study.\n\nSpecimen harvesting and preparation\n\nMice were euthanized via CO2 inhalation. Serum was collected via cardiac puncture at euthanasia, following a 2‐hour fast. After being cleaned of its soft tissue, the right femur was wrapped in saline‐soaked gauze and stored at −20°C until mechanical testing. The left femur was prepared for histology and imaging in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Wet weight of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were obtained at end of study, and normalized to body weight.\n\nHistology and quantitative histomorphometry\n\nQualitative histologic analysis and quantitative static and dynamic histomorphometry were performed as described.11 Calcein (15 mg/kg) and demeclocycline (40 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 8 and 2 days, respectively, prior to necropsy to allow for the investigation of bone formation rates. Histomorphometric measurements were performed on the secondary spongiosa of the distal femoral metaphysis using an OsteoMeasure morphometry system (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA, USA). Static measurements in thin sections stained with Von Kossa/tetrachrome included osteoblast surface (Ob.S/BS, %) and osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS, %). For dynamic histomorphometry, mineralizing surface per bone surface (MS/BS, %) and mineral apposition rate (MAR, μm/day) were measured in unstained sections under ultraviolet light, and used to calculate bone formation rate with a surface referent (BFR/BS, μm3/μm2/day). Terminology and units follow the recommendations of the Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).12\n\nMechanical testing\n\nFresh frozen femurs were thawed and subjected to three‐point bending (Bose ElectroForce 3200 with 150 N load cell; Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA), with the anterior surface on the two lower support points spaced 8 mm apart and a constant displacement rate of 0.03 mm/s. Force‐displacement data were acquired at 30 Hz and used to determine maximum force (N), stiffness (N/mm), work to failure (N*mm), postyield displacement (mm), and estimated elastic modulus (MPa).\n\nBone microarchitecture\n\nWe used high‐resolution microcomputed tomography (μCT40; Scanco Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) to assess bone morphology and microarchitecture. Briefly, the distal femur and femoral midshaft regions were scanned using 70 kVp, 50 mAs, and 12‐μm isotropic voxel size. We assessed bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), connectivity density (ConnD, 1/mm3), and structure model index (SMI) from a cancellous bone region that spanned 240 μm to 2040 μm distal of the growth plate in the femoral metaphysis region. We obtained the cancellous bone region using a semiautomated contouring program that separated it from the cortical bone. Cortical bone was analyzed from the metaphysis (surrounding the trabecular volume of interest) and from a 0.6‐mm‐long mid‐diaphyseal region. At the femoral midshaft, we assessed total cross sectional area, cortical bone area, and medullary area (TA, BA and MA, respectively, mm2); cortical bone area fraction (Ct.BA/TA, %), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), porosity (Ct.Po, %) and minimum, maximum, and polar moments of inertia (Imin, Imax, and J, respectively, mm4). Bone was segmented from soft tissue using the same threshold for all groups, 267 mg hydroxyapatite (HA)/cm3 for trabecular and 682 mg HA/cm3 for cortical bone. Scanning and analyses adhered to published guidelines.13\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll data were checked for normality, and standard descriptive statistics were computed. Treatment effects were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or repeated measures ANOVA for all continuous variables, followed by Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) to test for differences between groups. Initial body mass was calculated as the average of body mass measurements made on day 0 and 1, whereas final body mass was the average of measurements made on day 18 or 19 and day 21. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Data are reported as mean ± SE, unless noted.",
  "results": "Results\n\nBody mass and muscle mass\n\nBody mass was unchanged in the CON‐VEH and CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc groups, whereas both HLU groups experienced a transient decrease in body mass compared to baseline in the first 3 days. However, only the HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc group experienced a small sustained decrease in body weight compared to baseline and to the normally‐loaded control group (–6% compared to CON‐VEH, p < 0.01 for both). As expected, HLU caused significant muscle atrophy in the hindlimb, as the gastrocnemius wet weight normalized to body weight was approximately 15% lower in the HLU‐VEH and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc groups than in their respective controls (p < 0.01 for both). The soleus had greater atrophy, with a normalized wet weight that was about 40% lower in HLU mice than in fully loaded controls (p < 0.001 for both HLU groups). mBMPR1A‐mFc had no effect on muscle mass (Supporting Table  1).\n\nBMD\n\nHindlimb and total body BMD both increased slightly from baseline in CON‐VEH, whereas BMD values declined significantly in the HLU‐VEH group at both sites (Fig. 1). In comparison, mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment increased BMD in normally loaded animals and either prevented BMD loss (hindlimb region) or increased BMD (total body) in the HLU group (Fig. 1). Specifically, hindlimb BMD increased 4.4% ± 0.8% in CON‐VEH and declined −5.3% ± 1.3% in the HLU‐VEH group (p < 0.01 versus baseline for both). Hindlimb BMD increased by 10.2% ± 0.6% in normally loaded controls treated with mBMPR1A‐mFc (p < 0.01 versus baseline and versus CON‐VEH), whereas hindlimb BMD was maintained in HLU mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFc (0.3% ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU‐VEH). Patterns for total body BMD were similar, except that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFC in the HLU group led to significantly increased BMD versus baseline, and significantly higher BMD than the HLU‐VEH group (Fig. 1). The increase in total body BMD in mBMPR1A‐mFc treated animals was significantly greater in CON than HLU (p interaction < 0.001).\n\nBone microarchitecture\n\nOverall, HLU worsened trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFC treatment improved bone microarchitecture in both CON and HLU groups compared to VEH (Table 1, Fig. 1). For example, compared to CON‐VEH, HLU‐VEH had 22% and 14% lower Tb.BV/TV and Tb.Th, respectively (all p < 0.05). In cortical bone, mid‐shaft cortical area was 15% smaller, cortical thickness was 14% thinner, and polar moment of inertia was 16% lower in HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH (all p < 0.05). Trabecular architecture was markedly enhanced in both CON and HLU mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFC compared to VEH‐treated mice, with 68% to 82% greater BV/TV, along with greater Tb.Th and connectivity density, and reduced Tb.Sp (all p < 0.05). In both CON and HLU groups, mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment also led to improvements in cortical bone microarchitecture at the mid‐diaphysis with 5% to 14% larger cortical bone area, 7% to 8% greater cortical bone area fraction, and 8% to 9% thicker cortical bone (all p < 0.05). These cortical changes appear to be due to endosteal bone apposition, as mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFC had lower midshaft medullary area but similar total cross‐sectional area as VEH‐treated groups (Table 1).\n\nMid‐femoral biomechanics\n\nThree‐point bending tests of the femur revealed that HLU‐VEH had lower bending stiffness (–25%) and maximum force (–23%) compared to CON‐VEH animals (p < 0.001, Table 2). In general, femoral biomechanical properties were not altered by mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment, except that HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFC animals had greater maximum force (+18%, p = 0.006) compared to HLU‐VEH (Table 2). There were no significant differences in postyield displacement between the groups.\n\nHistomorphometry\n\nBone formation was decreased by exposure to HLU, as HLU‐VEH had 50% lower MAR (p < 0.01) and a trend for lower MS/BS (p = 0.09), leading to a 2.8‐fold lower bone formation rate (p < 0.01) compared to CON‐VEH (Fig. 2). HLU‐VEH also tended to have lower osteoblast surface (20% ± 3% in CON‐VEH versus 14% ± 4% in HLU‐VEH, p = 0.17) but had similar osteoclast surface (2.10% ± 0.33% in CON‐VEH versus 2.51% ± 0.41% in HLU‐VEH). Treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFC led to a markedly increased mineralizing surface and MAR, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold increase in bone formation rate in the CON (p = 0.01) and HLU (p = 0.02) animals, respectively (Fig. 3). Treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFC did not affect osteoblast surface, but led to a 60% reduction in osteoclast surface in both the CON (2.10% ± 0.76% in VEH versus 0.76% ± 0.19% in mBMPR1A‐mFC, p = 0.003) and HLU (2.58% ± 0.41% in VEH versus 1.03% ± 0.12% in mBMPR1A‐mFC, p = 0.004) groups.",
