  "title": "Effects of Spaceflight on the Mouse Submandibular Gland",
  "abstract": "Objective:\n\nThis study was conducted to determine if the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland is affected by microgravity and the spaceflight environment.\n\nDesign:\n\nTissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry.\n\nResults:\n\nIn contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen after 30 d in space.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThese results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva contains proteins secreted from salivary glands and is easily collected, therefore is a useful biofluid for general medical analyses and in particular for monitoring the physiology and health of astronauts.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nSpaceflight exposes organisms to numerous environmental stressors, such as gravitational changes, radiation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise, confinement, and disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms. Previous studies of animals and humans after travel in space have documented alterations in several tissues and organ systems, including skeletal, immune, cardiovascular, nervous and gastrointestinal (e.g.,). Early and more recent studies have demonstrated that oral hard and soft tissues, including the mandible, teeth, salivary glands and saliva, are significantly affected by spaceflight.\n\nThe response of rodent salivary glands to spaceflight varies among glands and cell types. An increase in autophagy and apoptosis occurs in parotid acinar cells. Large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar cell proteins are present in intercalated and striated duct cells. Changes also occur in the expression of several acinar cell secretory proteins. In contrast, the sublingual gland shows few morphological alterations, but changes do occur in serous demilune cell protein expression.\n\nThe aims of the present study were to determine if spaceflight affects the morphology and secretory protein expression of the mouse submandibular gland. Glands from mice flown on two US space shuttle flights and from the Russian Bion-M1 satellite, along with ground control mice, were examined using transmission electron microcopy, immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling. The findings indicate that the three major salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight and suggest that the age and sex of the animals and the length of the flight affect the response.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nAnimals:\n\nEight 16-23 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 15 d on space shuttle Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131), and seven 9 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 13 d on space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135). The mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules, specially designed cages that provide ventilation, lighting, waste collection, food and water. Eight mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 15 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-131 flight, and 5 mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 13 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-135 flight. Six 15-16 wk old male C57BL/6N mice were flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 satellite. The mice were housed in “BOS” flight habitats. Four age-matched male C57BL/6N mice housed in the same flight habitats served as asynchronous ground controls. The experimental procedures were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Moscow State University Institute of Mitoengineering (Protocol No-35, 1 November, 2012), and the Biomedical Ethics Commission of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (Moscow) (protocol No–319, 4 April, 2013). All procedures conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. The samples were made available through the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program.\n\nFlight and habitat ground control mice on the space shuttle missions were provided with NASA rodent food bars attached to the sides of the Animal Enclosure Modules and water ad libitum. Five mice housed in standard vivarium cages, with rodent chow and water available ad libitum, served as additional ground control animals for the STS-135 mission. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the Bion-M1 mission were fed a paste diet based on standard rodent chow, with water and casein added as a gelling agent. The paste food was available at 4 h intervals. Four additional ground control mice were housed in standard vivarium cages and fed rodent chow and water ad libitum. Pre- and post-flight body weight and food consumption data have been published.\n\nSample Collection:\n\nDissection of the mice from the space shuttle flights began about 3 h after landing of the shuttles at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida; dissection of the habitat ground control mice took place 48 h after the flight mice. The vivarium-housed mice were dissected 48 h prior to dissection of the STS-135 flight mice. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Dissection of the Bion-M1 flight mice took place at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow, beginning about 13 h after landing in the Orenburg region of Russia. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The vivarium control mice were dissected immediately after the flight mice, and the asynchronous habitat ground control mice were dissected 99 days after the flight mice.\n\nSubmandibular glands were removed, rinsed briefly in cold phosphate buffered saline and prepared for morphological and immunohistochemical examination. Small pieces of tissue for morphologic analysis were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Samples for immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After overnight fixation at 4°C, the samples were rinsed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and stored in either buffer (morphology) or 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (immunohistochemistry). The samples were shipped cold by express service from the dissection sites to UConn Health.\n\nMorphologic Analysis:\n\nThe samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, stained in block with 1% uranyl acetate, and processed by standard methods for embedding in PolyBed epoxy resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). Thin sections (~70-80 nm) were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined and photographed in a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT digital camera.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\n\nParaformaldehyde-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sections were cut at 5 μm thickness, and immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously, using the Vectastain Elite kits for rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. The sections were observed and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA) equipped with an Accu-Scope Excelis digital camera (Accu-Scope, Commack, NY, USA).\n\nImmunogold Labeling:\n\nPostfixation was omitted, and the paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were rinsed briefly in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in cold methanol solutions, embedded in LR Gold resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and polymerized in UV light at −20°C. Thin sections from each mouse of the flight and ground control groups from the three missions were collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. Immunolabeling was carried out overnight at 4°C as described previously, using primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in phosphate buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum. Immunolabeling controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Int., Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK, or Aurion, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The labeled grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in the transmission electron microscope.\n\nQuantitative Analyses:\n\nElectron micrographs of the labeled sections were obtained and analyzed in an unbiased manner as described previously. Labeling densities of secretory granules of acinar cells, terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells, and granular convoluted duct cells were calculated for each mouse as the average number of gold particles/μm2. For direct comparison between different immunogold labeling experiments, the labeling densities were converted to percentages of the corresponding ground control averages. Differences in expression of each protein between the flight and ground control groups were evaluated using ANOVA and t-test functions in Microsoft Excel or StatPlus (v.6.1.60, AnalystSoft, Walnut, CA, USA).\n\nAntibodies:\n\nPrimary antibodies used were to salivary androgen binding protein alpha (SABPα), proline-rich protein (PRP), submandibular gland protein C (SMGC), nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Table 1). A rabbit anti-chicken antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat No. ab97136) was used as a secondary antibody with the chicken anti-PRP primary.",
  "results": "Results\n\nThe flight and habitat ground control mice from both space shuttle missions lost approximately 1-2 g of body weight, but the differences were not statistically significant. Consumption of food and water were similar for the flight and habitat ground control mice. The flight and habitat ground control mice from the Bion-M1 mission gained approximately 2-2.5 g body weight; the differences were significant for the flight mice (p = 0.0010) and habitat ground control mice (p = 0.0456). Food consumption for the flight and habitat ground control mice, determined in preliminary experiments, was identical.\n\nMorphology:\n\nThe acinar cells of the mouse submandibular gland are seromucous in nature, with a basally located nucleus, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the basal cytoplasm, a large Golgi complex, and secretory granules with a granular content of moderate density located in the supranuclear cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A, B; see review by). In adult female glands, terminal tubule cells, also called granular intercalated duct cells, retained from prenatal and early postnatal stages, often are observed at the acinar-intercalated duct junction (Fig. 1C). These cells contain numerous small dense secretory granules ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.3 μm. In males, the terminal tubule cells undergo androgen-dependent apoptosis and are completely lost by about 1 month of age. The intercalated ducts, consisting of cuboidal cells that occasionally contain a few small granules, connect to a short striated granular duct which is confluent with the granular convoluted duct. The granular convoluted ducts consist of tall columnar cells, with basal nuclei, variably infolded basal cell membranes with adjacent mitochondria, and numerous large dense granules in the supranuclear cytoplasm. (Fig. 2) As described by, smaller dense granules often are present in the cytoplasm between the large granules. These ducts are well-developed in adult male glands, constituting about 45% to 60% of the gland parenchyma (Fig. 2A). In female glands, the granular convoluted duct cells are smaller than those of males, contain fewer secretory granules (Fig. 2B), and constitute about 25% of the parenchyma. The granular convoluted ducts are confluent with the striated ducts, which become excretory ducts as they enter the connective tissue septa dividing the gland into lobules and lobes.\n\nThere were no apparent differences in the morphology of the acinar or duct cells of flight mice from those of their respective habitat ground control or vivarium ground control mice for any of the three missions. All of the cellular organelles exhibited a normal appearance, and the acinar and duct cells had a full complement of secretory granules.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\n\nIn paraffin sections, antibodies to SABPα labeled all of the submandibular gland acinar cells (Fig. 3A), whereas no reactivity was present in duct cells. Antibody to NGF labeled the granular convoluted duct cells (Fig. 3B). In female mice, the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells were labeled with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 3C, D). No labeling was seen in control sections that were incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune serum or IgG substituted for the primary antibody (Fig. 3E).\n\nImmunogold labeling:\n\nIn the submandibular gland acinar cells, electron microscopic immunogold labeling with antibodies to SABPα and PRP resulted in labeling of the secretory granules (Fig. 4A, B). A few gold particles were also present over the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The labeling density for SABPα in female mice flown on STS-131 and STS-135 was not significantly different than in habitat ground control mice. In male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite, labeling for SABPα was significantly increased in flight mice compared to habitat control mice (Fig. 5). The labeling density for PRP was unchanged from controls in both female and male flight mice.\n\nIn the granular convoluted duct cells, immunogold labeling with antibodies to EGF and NGF resulted in labeling of the secretory granules (Fig. 4C, D). In our samples fixed only in paraformaldehyde, the secretory granules exhibited variable electron density. The immunogold labeling density is reported only for the electron dense and moderately electron dense granules. No differences were seen in the labeling densities for EGF and NGF between female flight and habitat ground control mice in the STS-131 and STS-135 missions. Although the EGF labeling was decreased in STS-135 flight mice, it was not significantly different from the habitat ground control mice due to substantial variability among the individual mice. Labeling for both EGF and NGF, however, was significantly increased in male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite compared to habitat ground control mice (Fig. 5).\n\nThe labeling of terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells in female mice from the STS-131 and STS-135 missions with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 4E) showed no difference between flight and habitat ground controls (Fig. 5).\n\nGround control vivarium mice were available for study for the STS-135 and Bion-M1 missions. Labeling of female vivarium control mice from the STS-135 mission with antibodies to PRP, EGF, NGF and SMGC was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling for SABPα, however, was greater in vivarium control mice than in flight mice (p<0.01) and habitat control mice (p<0.05). Labeling of male vivarium control mice from the Bion-M1 mission with antibodies to PRP and EGF was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling of vivarium control mice for SABPα and NGF was significantly less than in flight mice (p<0.05), but no different from habitat control mice.\n\nNon-specific labeling of sections incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune IgG instead of primary antibody was generally very low, in most cases in the range of 0% to 6% of the specific antibody labeling of secretory granules. Non-specific binding of primary antibodies to plastic in interstitial areas ranged from 0.37% to less than 5%.",
