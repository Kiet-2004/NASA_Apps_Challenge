  "title": "Desiccation Mitigates Heat Stress in the Resurrection Fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides",
  "abstract": "Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Qy when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nHeat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting plant growth, yield, and productivity. Temperatures beyond the “physiological capacity” of plants have debilitating effects on biochemical processes, cellular homeostasis, changes in enzyme activities, photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and membrane fluidity. Damage to photosystem (PS) II and associated proteins is reported to be a primary target of high temperature stress. Heat stress uncouples electron transport activity, ATP synthesis and variable (Fv), and maximum (Fm) chlorophyll fluorescence, which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, all of which induce oxidative stress. Furthermore, heat stress affects activity of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidases (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and low molecular weight antioxidants like ascorbic acid and glutathione (GSH), which change in response to heat stress.\n\nPlants not only experience heat- but also desiccation stress, which stems from loss of water via evapotranspiration. Distinguishing combined stresses is difficult because many of the physiological and molecular responses between these stresses overlap. Some studies suggest that the combination of these two stresses is more deleterious to plant growth and productivity than each individual stress and the response to combined stresses cannot be extrapolated from the individual stress. Therefore, studies typically report the combined effects of heat and drought stress. However, this approach obscures the individual stress response. Additionally, separating heat from desiccation stress is not possible in the field and difficult to establish even under laboratory conditions but leads to meaningful characterization of the metabolic response to individual stressors.\n\nPlants that are especially well-suited to study desiccation stress are “resurrection” plants. These plants are defined by their vegetative tissues being able to sustain desiccation to water potentials as low as −100 MPa. They can reach complete air dryness and rehydrate without suffering noticeable injury. Because these plants can sustain desiccation and attain certain levels of quiescence during this process, their heat tolerance can be tested in dry and hydrated conditions. A large body of research has reported thermotolerance capacity of non-vascular, poikilohydric species such as bryophytes and lichens. Although thermo and frost resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes and heat resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes and angiosperms was examined, there is no information on biochemical responses of these plants to elevated temperatures. Based on morphological and photosynthetic responses, there is general consensus that non-vascular and vascular plants show increased thermotolerance after desiccation. However, the dependency on seasonal conditions also indicates that desiccation alone is insufficient to establish thermotolerance. To dissect the biochemical responses to heat and desiccation, we studied the response of the desiccation tolerant fern Pleopletis polypodioides in dry and hydrated fronds. Because pteridophytes are widely distributed and successfully established in various environments, they not only provide essential information on the evolution of desiccation tolerance but also serve an excellent model to study the effects of heat stress.\n\nPleopeltis polypodioides (aka resurrection fern) can tolerate loss of 95% of cellular water content and regain full metabolic activities within a few hours of rehydration. In response to dehydration, the ventral surface curls inward and the dorsal surface, covered with peltate scales, remains exposed. Such folding mechanisms, also demonstrated by other resurrection plants, are thought to be a defensive mechanism against photooxidation. Although there is plenty of information on morphological changes of plants in response to heat and desiccation stress, adaptations of ferns to desiccation, and biochemical response to drought are limited. In addition, the response of Pleopeltis to heat has not been investigated.\n\nWe evaluate the biochemical responses of dry and hydrated fronds of Pleopeltis to heat by assessing their photosynthetic and metabolic activities, levels of stress molecules, activities of antioxidative enzymes, membrane stability, and the fatty acid profile. Our results indicate that independent of hydration, oxidative and antioxidative systems are sensitive to heat but dried fronds tolerate heat better than hydrated fronds.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nPlant Materials\n\nBecause Pleopeltis fronds are highly responsive to environmental conditions and are efficient in water uptake compared to plants with intact rhizomes, we focused on studying the thermal tolerance of isolated fronds. Hydrated fronds P. polypodioides were collected from live oak (Quercus virginiana) trees on the campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (30.21 N, −92.02 W). All fronds were collected after a rain event during March to May from 2016 to 2019 and prior to experimentation maintained in a humid chamber at high RH. All fronds were between 4.5 and 5 cm long. The outline of the workflow is illustrated in Figure 1 and individual methodologies explained below.\n\nHeat Treatment\n\nHeat treatment was applied for 24 h in darkness. Assays of heat treated dry and hydrated (fully and partly submersed) samples were compared with 25°C dry and fresh control, respectively.\n\nDehydrated Fronds\n\nDetached, fresh fronds were dried at 25°C for 72 h, which reduces the RWC to < 5%. After drying, the fronds were exposed to temperatures between 30 and 50°C for 24 h in an incubator. Relative humidity decreased as a function of temperature increase.\n\nHydrated Fronds\n\nDetached fresh fronds were placed in DI water in 20 mL glass vials such that either the entire frond (vial filled with 20 mL water) or just the apical end (4 mL water) was submersed and exposed to the same temperature as dried fronds. The reason for different levels of submersion was to test the effect of oxygen deprivation in fronds that were fully submersed compared to 100% humidity. The data were compared with hydrated fronds (without immersion) at 25°C.\n\nPhotosynthetic Performance\n\nThe photosynthetic performance of the fronds before and after heat stress and after re-hydration was assessed by measuring the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence (F0, which is equivalent to Ft if the leaf sample is dark-adapted) and quantum yield (Qy) using a FluorPen FP100 (Photo Systems Instruments, Czechia). F0 was measured by applying a light pulse (455 nm of 0.09 μmoles m–2s–1 for 30 μs) and recorded as Ft. Similarly, Qy measurements were obtained by applying a saturating light that measures maximum value of fluorescence (Fm) from PS II (approximately 3000 μmol m–2 s–1 for 0.8 s) to dark-adapted dry fronds and dim-light (∼10 μM m–2 s–1) exposed fronds. Preliminary measurements showed no difference between dark or dim-light adapted measurements. The difference between minimal fluorescence F0 and maximal fluorescence Fm divided by Fm, i.e., (Fm-F0)/Fm. We used this ratio to describe quantum yield (Qy) of PS II system. Normal photosynthetic activity shows maximum Qy of about 0.83. We considered reduced values indicative of stress.\n\nThe Ft and Qy data were collected from fresh, dried and 24 h heat treated fronds as well as after re-hydration for 1, 5, and 24 h at room temperature (25°C). Because obtaining reliable fluorescence measurements from curled (dried) fronds was difficult, the Ft and Qy measurements were obtained from flattened fronds that were dried between paper towels and glass plates for 5 days at room temperature. Dried and submersed fronds were examined after temperature treatments. Fronds were rehydrated on water-saturated foam under dim light, and were measured after 1, 5, and 24 h. Qy and Ft were identical in dark and dim-light-maintained fronds, we therefore report data of fronds measured under dim light (10 μM m–2 s–1). The Ft and Qy measurements were obtained from the base, center, and the tip of each of six fronds and shown as average of these positions.\n\nMembrane Permeability\n\nCell membrane permeability was deduced from the conductivity (μS cm–1) of the water in which the fronds were submersed. Conductivity was measured with a MW 301 EC meter (Milwaukee Instruments, Inc.) in 4 mL samples for partially and 20 mL samples in fully submersed fronds and reported as μS normalized to 10 mL. After heat treatments, fronds were kept at room temperature for an additional 24 h to assess re-uptake of ions. Elemental analysis was performed by Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, Optima 5300 DV) in 15% HNO3.\n\nMetabolic Activity\n\nIn their natural environment, Pleopeltis fronds are exposed to sometimes extreme fluctuations of temperatures, humidity, and light intensities. Our intention is to understand how Pleopeltis responds to heat stress. Because measuring enzyme activities of dried fronds inevitably requires hydration, metabolic activities of dried fronds may not represent the actual activity in the dried state but indicate available metabolites and metabolic capacity at the endpoint of dehydration. Despite these limitations, the following tests were performed with dehydrated and hydrated fronds.\n\nTissue Viability\n\nThe reduction of resazurin as described in served as proxy for the assessment of vitality. Pinnae [100 mg dry weight equivalents, calculated as FW/(1-RWC) as documented in ] were macerated in 2 mL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 0.2 mL of 4 mM resazurin (Sigma R7017), and incubated under continuous illumination (∼300 μM m–2 s–1) at 25°C for 3 h before the fluorescence of the supernatant was determined (Varian Cary, λex = 560 nm; λem = 590 nm).\n\nHydroperoxide Determination\n\nHydroperoxide (and other water-soluble peroxide) content was measured using the ferrous ammonium sulfate/xylenol orange, FOX I assay at 560 nm. Hydroperoxide quantification in μM was based on a standard curve and calculated as (OD560 – 0.004)/0.0763.\n\nMeasurement of Lipid Peroxide\n\nThe FOX II assay was used to quantify lipid peroxides, LOOHs according to such that (OD560 − 0.1305)/0.0383, determines the BHT equivalent in nM.\n\nCatalase Activity\n\nCatalase activity was determined from the decrease of OD240 of H2O2 for 180 s. Based on 100 mg samples, enzyme activity was expressed as μM × min–1 × mg protein–1.\n\nConsumption of Reduced Glutathione\n\nThe consumption of GSH was measured as described earlier. The assay was modified after. Samples (100 mg DW equivalent) were extracted in chilled sodium phosphate buffer (40 mM, pH 7, 2 mL) and centrifuged (23,000 g, 12 min, 4°C). 500 μL supernatant was transferred into a fresh centrifuge tube, mixed with 400 μL 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 μL 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma, S-2002), 200 μL DI water, and vortexed. After adding 200 μL (4 mM) GSH (Cayman chemical company, 10007461) and 100 μL 2.5 mM H2O2, the solution was mixed and incubated for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (Aldrich Chemical Company, 76-03-9). The solution was incubated at RT for 30 min and centrifuged (23,000 g, 5 min, 4°C). The supernatant (500 μL) was mixed with 1.5 mL 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 1 mL 5, 5’-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Sigma, D8130). After inversion, OD 409 was determined. Enzyme activity is reported as μM GSH consumed min–1 × mg protein–1.\n\nProtein Determination\n\nProtein content for the enzyme assays was determined according to using ovalbumin (Sigma, A-5378) as standard.\n\nFatty Acid Analysis\n\nFatty acids were extracted from tissue equivalent to 100 mg fresh weight, derivatized to their methyl esters, and quantified using an Agilent (Wilmington, DE, United States) gas chromatograph (6890) with mass selective detector (5973). One μL samples were injected and separated on a Phenomenex Zebron ZB-5MS column with hydrogen as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min–1. The temperature profile started at 100°C for 2 min, ramped (10°C × min–1) to 280°C and held for another 8 min. Identification of compounds was based on the National Institute of Science and Technology library 2008 in Chemstation software (E.02.02.1431). The quantity of individual fatty acids was determined based on retention time and slope of derivatized palmitic acid (Sigma, P-5917; Rt = 11.7 min; 3.98 × 106 TIC ng–1), linoleic acid (Sigma, L1376; Rt = 13.3 min, 3.53 × 106 TIC ng–1), linolenic acid (Cayman Chemical Company, 90210; Rt = 13.37 min; 2.51 × 106 TIC ng–1), oleic acid (Sigma, O1630; Rt = 13.4 min; 1.88 × 106 TIC ng–1), and stearic acid (Sigma, S-4751; Rt = 13.6 min; 3.05 × 106 TIC ng–1). Tissue samples were analyzed under identical conditions as standards.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nThe data are reported as means of three to six biological replicates obtained from individual fronds. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test was performed using Excel data analysis tool pack.",
  "results": "Results\n\nMorphological Response\n\nPinnae of dried Pleopeltis fronds curled tighter with increasing temperature treatment (Figures 2A–C). Dried tissue showed no effects, but discolorations became visible after rehydration. Exposure to 55°C resulted in patchy browning along the mid-rib (rachis) of the frond (Figure 2D); after 60°C fronds were slightly (Figure 2E) and after 65°C completely discolored (Figure 2F). Submersed (Figure 2G) and partly submersed (Figure 2J) fronds showed no effects at 30°C but after exposure > 40°C submersed (Figures 2H,I) and partly submersed (Figures 2K,L) fronds showed browning.\n\nPhotosynthetic Performance\n\nDried Frond\n\nInstantaneous fluorescence (Ft) of treated dried fronds measured lower than (control) dry fronds at 25°C (Figure 3A) while Qy of fronds exposed to 30°C and higher was not detectable (Figure 3B). Interestingly, Ft of 65°C treated samples was higher than 60°C and not different from control (Figure 3A), whereas Qy even after rehydration remained undetectable (Figure 3B).\n\nRe-hydrated Fronds\n\nAfter rehydration, the chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) increased over time and reached control levels within 5 h for temperatures up to 35°C (Figure 3A). However, exposure to higher temperatures (≤55°C) required a recovery period of 24 h. Despite the high Ft values, the Qy decreased with higher temperatures (Figure 3B). Ft of 1-h re-hydrated fronds was low compared to (fresh) control but measurable at all temperature ranges, i.e., 30–65°C (Figure 3A). However, the Qy value decreased from 30 to 50°C and was not detectable at > 50°C (Figure 3B). Similarly, Ft of fronds re-hydrated for 5 h after less than 40°C showed values similar to (fresh) controls (Figure 3A) but Ft was lower in rehydrated fronds exposed to ≥ 45° [F(5,30) = 18, P < 0.0001]. The Qy of 5 h re-hydrated fronds was lower than in controls [F(8,45) = 37.5, P < 0.0001] but greater than after 1 h re-hydration [F(1,94) = 55.8, P < 0.0001] (Figure 3B). Beyond 45°C, Qy efficiency decreased steadily with increasing temperature (Figure 3B); there was no recovery after exposure to 65°C. Based on these data, Qy is a better indicator of sensing heat than Ft.\n\nHydrated Fronds\n\nDespite some increase after 30 and 40°C treatments, Ft of partially submersed fronds decreased after exposure to temperatures higher than 40°C [F(2,15) = 312, P < 0.0001] (Figure 3C); in contrast Qy was already significantly reduced at 40°C [F(1,10) = 217, P < 0.0001] (Figure 3D). After recovery (at room temperature for 24 h), Ft and Qy of 30 and 35°C treated samples did not differ from controls (Figures 3C,D). However, in 40°C treated samples Qy remained significantly lower than base-line values [F(1,10) = 711.6, P < 0.0001], which suggests that hydration is beneficial for samples exposed to temperatures below 40°C. Unchanging but measurable Ft values in ≥ 45°C fronds and the lack of recovery of Qy after 40°C indicates degradation of PS II.\n\nIn fully submersed samples, chlorophyll fluorescence was higher but Qy suppression was stronger than in partly submersed fronds (Figure 3F). All heat-stressed samples showed reduced Ft values after the recovery period, indicating that chlorophyll degradation continues during this time. The Qy values of ≥ 40°C treated samples remained undetectable (Figure 3F). Overall, the samples exposed to ≥ 40°C showed a response similar to partially submersed fronds. The data clearly show that hydration renders the photosynthetic apparatus more sensitive to heat stress than dried fronds. Importantly, the similarity between partial and full hydration suggests that reduced gas exchange in submersed fronds is not the cause of the decline of Qy.\n\nIon Leakage\n\nTo assess the response of cell membranes to heat stress, we measured the conductivity of external water from partly and fully submersed samples treated between 30 and 50°C (Figure 4). Although the fronds were washed before the experiments to minimize surface contamination, the conductivity (normalized to 10 mL) at 30 and 35°C were not different from controls, did not differ between partly and fully submersed samples, and likely represents surface-bound ions or normal ion exchange. However, treatment of ≥ 40°C strongly increased the conductivity of fully and partly submersed fronds, indicating membrane leakiness (Figure 4). There was no reduction in conductivity after 24 h recovery at RT (Figure 4); thus, there was no re-uptake of ions during the recovery phase. The conductivities of submersed samples were higher than those of partly submersed samples (Figure 4). The ion concentration was clearly dependent on the extent of immersion, indicating that long-distance transport did not contribute to the ion release.\n\nElemental analysis of the leachate revealed that K+ is the major released ion followed by Ca+2 and S (Figure 5). Na+ and Mg2+ were present at lower quantities. K+ and S in the leachate increased with temperature and both elements showed the largest increase at 40°C (Figure 5). Ca+2 loss occurred more evenly across the tested temperature range and like Na+ did not show a distinct threshold temperature (Figure 5). Unlike partly submersed samples, the ions from submersed fronds did not increase beyond 40°C, which indicates that membrane damage occurs at that temperature.\n\nReducing Capacity\n\nGeneric reducing capacity represents overall metabolic activity. Dried fronds showed significantly lower activity than hydrated tissue [F(4,25) = 19.6, P < 0.0001] below 45°C but their reducing capacity exceeded that of submersed tissue at higher temperatures (Figure 6) regardless of the type of submersion. Despite declining reducing capacity of dried fronds at elevated temperatures, dried fronds showed metabolic activity. Likewise, the reducing capacity remained higher in partly than in fully submersed fronds [F(1,10) = 4.9, P = 0.05] (Figure 6).\n\nHydroperoxides\n\nThe hydroperoxide content of dried fronds increased gradually with temperature and reached a maximum at 40°C (Figure 7). Fully and partly submersed fronds responded similarly and showed their highest values at 35°C (Figure 7). Higher temperatures led to a decrease on peroxides that was less in dried than in submersed fronds. The moderate increase in dry but stronger increase in hydrated fronds suggests that peroxide accumulates during heat stress but declines when the stress exceeds the metabolic capacity.\n\nLipid Hydroperoxides\n\nThe LOOH pattern was similar to hydroperoxides; dried fronds showed a steady increase with temperature with a maximum at 40°C [F(4,15) = 3.7, P = 0.03] (Figure 8). Partly and fully submersed samples reached their maximum at 35°C but showed lower levels of LOOH than dried fronds at 45 and 50°C (Figure 8), likely related to damaged metabolism, which weakens the response. Therefore, similar to the hydroperoxide profile, the maximum LOOH values signal the onset of non-compensated, i.e., damaging, heat stress.\n\nCatalase Activity\n\nThe greatest difference between dried and fresh tissue was measured at 25°C (Figure 9). Dried fronds showed their highest CAT activity at 30°C but the decline at higher temperatures was less than in hydrated fronds [F(2,57) = 3.1, P = 0.05]. Like dry fronds, submersed fronds showed a steady decline in CAT activity and the extent of submersion had no effect (Figure 9). Because CAT activity in dried fronds was significantly higher after 30°C treatment than at 25°C and significantly reduced in hydrated fronds at 35°C, CAT activity was higher in hydrated vs. dried tissue. CAT activity is remarkably temperature sensitive and the decline at 35°C indicates a stress response of CAT-linked processes.\n\nGlutathione (GSH) Consumption\n\nGlutathione consumption responded stronger to desiccation than heat stress [F(2,57) = 363, P < 0.0001] (Figure 10). GSH consumption in dried fronds decreased at ≥ 45°C [F(1,6) = 13.3, P = 0.01] compared to 30–40°C treated samples (Figure 10). GSH consumption of hydrated fronds showed a similar reduction and the extent of submersion had no effect. GSH utilization of 30°C dried and hydrated samples did not differ from the respective 25°C controls.\n\nFatty Acid (FA) Profile\n\nTemperature stress changed the FA composition and quantity in all samples. The total FA content in dehydrated fronds increased up to 35°C but decreased at higher temperatures (Figure 11A). In partly and fully submersed fronds, the total fatty acid reached its peak at 30°C and declined at higher temperatures (Figures 11B,C); the FA content in 50°C treated dried and hydrated samples was 76% and 90% lower than 30°C treated fronds, respectively (Figure 11).\n\nPalmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), and linolenic (18:3) acid were detected in controls and heat-treated fronds but linolenic acid (18:3) was the dominant FA at all temperatures and the total amount of fatty acids in fully submersed fronds was higher than in dried and partly submersed samples (Figure 11).\n\nThe extent of unsaturation correlated with peroxidation; therefore, we examined the degree of unsaturation for each temperature. The percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (18:1, 18:2, 18:3) in 30°C, dried and partly submersed samples was 12 and 5% lower than at 25°C (Figure 11). Exposure to temperatures higher than 30°C decreased unsaturation, especially in partly submersed samples (Figure 11 and Supplementary Table 1). Regardless of the hydration condition, after exposure to temperatures of 45°C and higher, all FAs showed reduced but equal quantities. In general, the relative proportion of unsaturated fatty acids was higher in dried than in hydrated fronds; and declined in dried fronds above 40°C; this reduction began in hydrated fronds at 35°C.",
