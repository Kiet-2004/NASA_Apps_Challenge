  "title": "Genomic Characterization of Potential Plant Growth-Promoting Features of Sphingomonas Strains Isolated from the International Space Station",
  "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nIn an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), several Sphingomonas strains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as Sphingomonas sanguinis (n = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identified 23 Sphingomonas species. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for S. sanguinis in the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS S. sanguinis isolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these Sphingomonas strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterized Sphingomonas sp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future.\n\nIMPORTANCE Sphingomonas is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the Sphingomonas genus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of Sphingomonas members from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.",
  "introduction": "INTRODUCTION\n\nSphingomonas species are found in a variety of habitats, including soil, marine sediments, wastewater, and freshwater, in addition to the habitats contaminated with dyes, herbicides, and other pollutants. They possess diverse catabolic capabilities; for instance, assimilation of different types of complex sugars, including polysaccharides, was reported. Some species are tolerant to copper, resulting in biofilm formation and eventually surface corrosion, and some aid in herbicide mineralization or degradation of pollutants. Sphingomonas paucimobilis has been isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) potable drinking water, ISS surfaces, and hospital clinical specimens and is known to cause rare infections in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nRecent reports have identified the role of some Sphingomonas species in plant growth promotion. Microorganisms aid in plant growth promotion via different mechanisms, including secreting metabolites like phytohormones, solubilizing phosphate, fixating nitrogen, inducing stress response pathways, or acting as biocontrol agents. Phytohormones play a significant role in plant metabolism and defense mechanisms. For instance, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is responsible for promoting cell division, elongation, and differentiation and is involved in a wide range of plant processes ranging from responses to light and gravity to heavy metal stress tolerance. Recent studies have detailed the role of Sphingomonas species in plant growth promotion via the production of phytohormones and increased stress tolerance. S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 produces phytohormones like IAA, salicylic acid, zeatin, and abscisic acid and helps in nitrogen fixation. Sphingomonas sp. LK11, isolated from the leaves of the arid medicinal plant Tephrosia apollinea, was shown to produce auxins and gibberellins and was reported to increase stress tolerance to salinity and cadmium in tomato plants. In addition, genomic analysis of Sphingomonas sp. LK11 also revealed genes for hydrogen peroxide production that enhance plant growth, seed germination, and root colonization, genes for phosphate uptake, osmotic stress, and heavy metal stress. Genomic analysis of Sphingomonas panacis DCY99T isolated from the roots of Panax ginseng identified genes for IAA production, phosphate solubilization, heavy metal stress tolerance, and degradation of phenolic compounds. Furthermore, Sphingomonas sp. Cra20 was shown to improve plant growth under drought stress conditions by altering the rhizosphere microbial community. The ability of microorganisms to produce phytohormones thus offers the potential to manipulate plant growth and development but without the need to supplement hormones externally to the plants.\n\nIn an ongoing microbial tracking experiment on the ISS, several microbial strains belonging to Sphingomonas sanguinis (n = 2) were isolated from the ISS, and a third strain identified as S. paucimobilis was cultured from the Kennedy Space Center, Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF). After the isolation of Sphingomonas strains from the ISS, a complete genome (∼4.4 Mbp) was also assembled from the shotgun reads retrieved from the same ISS environmental surface, resulting in the production of a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) belonging to S. sanguinis. Given the persistence of Sphingomonas bacteria among spaceflight-relevant surfaces, and a growing body of evidence for Sphingomonas strains to promote plant growth, this study applies comparative genomic analyses to identify genetic determinants that relate to plant growth-promoting features (PGPF) and highlights those that may be adaptive to growth on spaceflight-relevant environments and surfaces. Our findings report the presence of several determinants for the production of plant phytohormones, including several gene products promoting resistance to sources of abiotic stress, with emphasis on oxidative/osmotic stress resistance, heavy metal tolerance, and adaptation to sources of radiation. Further, the production of a phytohormone, IAA, by these isolates was confirmed using metabolomics. Moreover, intersection analysis of functional annotations and orthologous groups from the Sphingomonas species from spaceflight-relevant surfaces (KSC-PHSF, ISS) revealed potential differences in gene contents involved in the horizontal gene transfer that are notably absent in their respective type strains. Taken together, our results show how characterization of microorganisms with respect to their ability to promote plant growth, including vegetables that can be used as a food source, will contribute to the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future.",
  "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nSample collection and whole-genome sequence analysis.\n\nSample collection and processing, followed by WGS and assembly that led to the isolation of Sphingomonas strains, are described elsewhere. Samples collected across different locations on the ISS, and the KSC-PHSF cleanroom, were plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A) to culture different bacterial colonies. In addition to cultivation, previously published metagenomic sequences sampled from ISS locations were downloaded from NCBI and analyzed for the presence of Sphingomonas species, and MAGs were generated.\n\nDNA extraction was followed by metagenomic sequencing and assembly as described previously. Identification of Sphingomonas spp. from metagenomic assembly was performed as described elsewhere. In the case of S. sanguinis genome assembled from the metagenome, sample collection, processing, and DNA extraction were carried out as reported previously. The assembled draft genomes were annotated using NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) 4.11. The identity of the strains was confirmed based on ANI calculated using EZBioCloud.\n\nGenome annotation.\n\nTo further explore potential functional differences between spaceflight isolates and their respective type strains, we obtained coding sequences from the NCBI RefSeq database and, where applicable, performed additional annotation through the online eggNOG-mapperV2 web server using the default settings. The coding sequences of the metagenome-assembled genome of S. sanguinis ISS-IIF7SWP were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. Coding nucleotide sequences for each Sphingomonas genome along with their respective type strains were annotated using the online eggNOG-MapperV2 software, whose column-based outputs were parsed and compared on a per-genome basis using a custom python script (available for use via https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook). Preliminary annotations of these select spaceflight isolates highlighted potential connections to the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11, a strain well characterized with respect to its plant growth-promoting capabilities. Given the presence of a thoroughly annotated and complete genome sequence, robust evidence for the production of the plant phytohormones gibberellic acid (GA) and IAA, and previous use as a model for novel plant-associated Sphingomonas genomes, Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was selected as a reference genome to identify putative plant growth-promoting features in other Sphingomonas genomes. In this study, the endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11, two S. sanguinis isolates (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5), and one S. sanguinis MAG (ISS-IIF7SWP) sampled from the ISS, S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 cultured from KSC-PHSF, and S. paucimobilis LCT-SP1 isolated from the Chinese spacecraft Shenzhou X were compared against their respective type strains: S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T and S. paucimobilis NCTC 11030T.\n\nMetabolite extraction and analysis.\n\nPrevious reports have characterized the phytohormone production capability of several Sphingomonas species, including Sphingomonas sp. LK11, S. panacis DCY99T, and S. paucimobilis ZJSH1. While both S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 and Sphingomonas sp. LK11 were confirmed to produce the plant phytohormone IAA, the definitive chemical pathway responsible for their production is yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the potential for the production of the auxin-derivative IAA in each of the selected S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis strains was examined. The space isolates (S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5, and S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1) were streaked on R2A (Difco, USA) and incubated at 28°C for 5 days. The strains were then inoculated in nutrient broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) containing 3 g/L l-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 28°C, 180 rpm for 7 days. To examine the phytohormones produced and secreted in culture filtrate, we pelleted the cells and extracted the metabolites from the supernatant using ethyl acetate. This step was repeated twice. The culture supernatant was then acidified using 6N HCl and metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer after each step described above was transferred to a fresh tube and evaporated in TurboVap LV. The residue obtained after drying the solvent was resuspended in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/95% (vol/vol) methanol at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. A suitable aliquot of the extract (10 μL) was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis.\n\nStock solution of IAA standard (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was prepared in 5% DMSO/95% methanol (vol/vol) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. It was diluted 10 times, and 10 μL of the dilution was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. HPLC-DAD-MS was carried out using Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with an RP C18 column (Alltech Prevail C18 3 mm 2.1 by 100 mm) at a flow rate of 125 μL/min. The solvent gradient for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was 95% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (MeCN)/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (vol/vol; solvent A), both containing 0.05% (vol/vol) formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 30 min, 100% solvent B from 30 to 45 min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 45 to 45.10 min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45.10 to 50 min.\n\nComparative functional analysis.\n\nGenome similarities between spaceflight Sphingomonas strains, their respective type strains, and the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 were visualized using BRIG version 0.95 with the Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (chromosome and plasmids) assigned as the reference genome. Percent identity values for space isolates and corresponding type strains were calculated using blastn (E value: 10, lower identity cutoff: 70%, upper identity cutoff: 90%).\n\nTo address potential functional differences between space isolates and their corresponding type strains, custom Python and R scripts (https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook) were designed to parse output annotation tables and summarize their features on a per-genome basis. Descriptions for select KEGG IDs identified in eggNOG-MapperV2 were assigned using the BioServices API. To identify protein-level differences between the Sphingomonas strains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains, custom python scripts were created to construct pileup gene count tables for the annotations generated from the EggNOG-MapperV2 software. Genes identified by eggNOG-MapperV2 for the S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis spaceflight isolates were pooled on a species basis and then compared to their type strains using JVENN and UpSetR using intersection analyses. Output tables generated by these analyses are displayed in Table S1.\n\nPangenome analysis.\n\nPangenome analysis of the Sphingomonas space isolates, their type strains, and the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was performed using Anvi’o v6.2. Primary functional annotation in the Anvi’o software was conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene clustering was carried out using blastp via the anvi-pan-genome command (–num-threads 2, –mcl-inflation 6, –min-bit 0.5, –use-ncbi-blast). The ordering of the pangenome display was determined using Euclidean distances and ward linkage settings.\n\nEthics approval and consent to participate.\n\nBecause no human subjects were characterized, ethics approval is not needed.\n\nData availability.\n\nAll sequence data used in this study have been uploaded to NCBI GenBank under accession numbers JABEOW000000000, JABEOV000000000, JABEOU000000000, and JABYQV000000000.",
  "results": "RESULTS\n\nAbundance of Sphingomonas species in the ISS.\n\nAmong the cultivable bacteria, three colonies obtained from ISS surfaces (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5) and one from KSC (FKI-L5-BR-P1) were identified as Sphingomonas species. All ISS strains were S. sanguinis, and the KSC strain was S. paucimobilis. The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and the draft genomes assembled were further used to confirm the identity of the species based on average nucleotide identity (ANI; Table 1), which was calculated to be ∼99% with the nearest type strain. Genomic characteristics and other details of the annotation are given in Table 1. The metagenomic data analysis identified 23 Sphingomonas species from flight 2, all of which were isolated from location 7, that is, a panel near the portable water dispenser (LAB) (Fig. 1). In addition, the reads obtained from flight 1 belonging to a single species, Sphingomonas sanxanigenens, were also seen in samples from flights 2 and 3 (Fig. 1). However, its location on the ISS varied across different flights. Reads obtained from flight 3 also showed the presence of S. paucimobilis from location 4, that is, the dining table (node 1). The metagenomic reads thus obtained from the ISS show that Sphingomonas species persisted across all three flights, with S. sanguinis being abundant among all Sphingomonas species in flight 2. Furthermore, the MAG sequence (ISS-IIF7SWP) exhibited >99.6% ANI with the type strain of S. sanguinis (Table 1). The MAG was derived from the exact location on the ISS where S. sanguinis isolates IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5 were retrieved using cultivation techniques. It was also confirmed that the MAG genome had >99% ANI value with the genomes of the S. sanguinis strains isolated from the ISS. The use of the culture-dependent and -independent methods thus confirms the presence of S. sanguinis on the ISS.\n\nPlant growth-promoting features in Sphingomonas species isolated from spaceflight environments.\n\nBLAST-based genome comparisons visualized using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across each spaceflight genome and their type strains compared against the Sphingomonas sp. LK11 genome (Fig. 2). Additionally, patterns of GC content for each S. sanguinis (66.1 to 66.2%) and S. paucimobilis (65.5%) genome were highly similar to that of LK11 (66.09%). Subsequent pangenome comparisons conducted by Anvi’o revealed a substantial core genome and further support both shared nucleotide and functional identity among these spaceflight Sphingomonas genomes, their type strains, and the endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (Fig. 3).\n\nDue to the high degree of functional identity shared between each of the space Sphingomonas species and Sphingomonas sp. LK11, functional annotations for each of the spaceflight Sphingomonas genomes and their type strains were conducted to identify putative PGPF. Functional analysis of these outputs revealed that many PGPFs proposed for Sphingomonas sp. LK11 are likely also present in the analyzed S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis genomes. Annotations reported from the EggNOGv5 database suggest that several gene products proposed to promote phosphate and sulfur assimilation in plants are also present in these select Sphingomonas strains, albeit with some species-specific patterns. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake metabolism and solubilization in soil appear to be conserved across all the selected S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis strains; however, gene products associated with sulfate/thiosulfate and hydrogen production may be exclusive to the selected S. sanguinis strains. Furthermore, several pathways proposed to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including the heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be shared between these selected S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis genomes.\n\nPrevious reports suggested that responses to oxidative stress in Sphingomonas sp. LK11 may promote plant host tolerance to abiotic stress via the amelioration of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, specific gene products related to oxidative stress resistance in space-associated Sphingomonas strains were further identified. Analysis of annotations generated by PGAP and eggNOG-MapperV2 suggested that space-associated Sphingomonas strains harbor multiple copies of several classes of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases, and glutaredoxins. Next, we sought to identify metabolic pathways suggested to reduce the abundance of ROS, for instance, carotenoids, which are known for their antioxidant activity. Examination of PGAP and eggNOG annotations suggest that all Sphingomonas strains analyzed in this study possess the genetic repertoire (crtB, crtI, crtY, crtZ) to produce the carotenoid zeaxanthin from the precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (Fig. 4A). Further analysis also revealed the presence of an unnamed sterol desaturase family protein, often proximate to these gene clusters, which shared high identity to the crtG gene product identified in Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 (74% to 75% identity). CrtG converts zeaxanthin to produce the yellow pigment nostoxanthin, a common carotenoid produced by Sphingomonas. Likewise, two pathways for the production of the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose were also identified in both the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Trehalose serves a variety of functions across organisms, acting as a carbon source, a compatible solute, and a metabolite that provides protection against a variety of abiotic stressors. These results suggest that Sphingomonas strains can potentially synthesize trehalose from the otsA/B pathway, wherein a two-step mechanism catalyzes the formation of trehalose 6-phosphate from the condensation of glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose residues (otsA) and subsequent dephosphorylation of trehalose 6-phosphate into the disaccharide trehalose (otsB). Additionally, trehalose could also be produced in these bacteria through catabolism of α(1,4) glucose polymers into trehalose via the treY/Z pathway (Fig. 4B).\n\nThese findings suggest that the tested Sphingomonas species, including the strains sequenced from spaceflight-relevant surfaces, contain several pathways likely to confer resistance to a variety of abiotic stressors, especially with respect to several antioxidant enzymes and metabolites. The presence of these features supports the potential role of these newly sequenced Sphingomonas strains to promote plant growth and increase plant stress tolerance.\n\nIndole-3-acetic acid production by S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains isolated from the ISS.\n\nOne of the sources of IAA biosynthesis is the amino acid tryptophan, and analysis of the orthologous groups identified by the eggNOGv5 database suggested that the selected Sphingomonas strains possess the required tryptophan biosynthesis genes (trpA,B,C,D,E,F), consistent with observations from previous reports in the literature. Leveraging the inclusion of several KEGG orthologs, enzyme classes, and KEGG reactions outputs via eggNOG-MapperV2, potential pathways for these Sphingomonas to synthesize IAA from tryptophan are proposed (Fig. 4C). Analysis of the functional annotations transferred from the EggNOGv5 database pointed to a group of carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family proteins that may act as putative nitrilases (E.C 3.5.5.1), converting indole-3-acetonitrile directly to IAA. Similarly, each of the analyzed Sphingomonas strains harbors a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase (putative monoamine oxidase EC 1.4.3.4), which likely promotes the conversion of tryptamine into indole-3-acetaldehyde. However, subsequent steps allowing the conversion of indole-3-acetaldehyde to IAA via an unnamed aldehyde dehydrogenase family protein (EC 1.2.1.3) were exclusive to the analyzed S. paucimobilis genomes. Further, the presence of indole-pyruvate ferredoxin, an enzyme which is responsible for the conversion of indole-3-pyruvate into S-2-(indol-3-yl)acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), was also exclusive to S. paucimobilis; however, it is unclear as to how S. paucimobilis may further alter S-2-(indol-3-yl)acetyl-CoA into IAA. While two putative mechanisms across both S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis that may directly yield IAA from tryptophan-derived metabolites are supported by the results of functional annotation, we failed to identify canonical mechanisms for the formation of the upstream reactants in tryptophan metabolism, suggesting that novel mechanisms for IAA formation may occur in Sphingomonas and species-dependent pathways may supplement a shared metabolic pathway. Interestingly, while an auxin export carrier family protein was identified in each of the analyzed S. paucimobilis genomes, no such protein was identified in S. sanguinis.\n\nSince the genomic analysis of the spaceflight isolates revealed genetic signatures for the production of several plant growth-promoting hormones, metabolomic characterization was carried out to identify the phytohormone IAA. All Sphingomonas isolates obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces were cultured in the presence of tryptophan, and metabolites extracted from the culture filtrate were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). The MS data analysis showed the presence of IAA among the metabolites extracted from all three strains, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5, and S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 (Fig. 5A). The production of IAA (molecular weight, M = 175.18 g/mol) by these isolates was confirmed by comparing the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) profile (positive mode: M+H = ∼176 g/mol) of IAA standard with culture extracts, either alone or mixed with IAA standard (Fig. 5A). The ESI-MS profile of all the three culture extracts was found to be comparable with the standard. Further, the production of IAA was validated by tandem mass spectrometry to generate a mass fragmentation profile in positive mode, corresponding to M+H of ∼176 g/mol. The three culture extracts resulted in a fragmentation pattern that was similar to the IAA standard, generating three different fragments, including a parent ion of ∼176 g/mol (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the presence of IAA was not observed in nutrient media without tryptophan (data not shown). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data also revealed the presence of few other metabolites with molecular weights similar to those of other phytohormones; however, their positive identification will require further analysis, which is outside the scope of this study.\n\nFunctional differences between ISS Sphingomonas isolates and their type strains.\n\nAnalysis of plant growth-promoting features suggested the potential for conserved functional characteristics between the spaceflight and type strains of S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis genomes but with some distinctions. Therefore, functional differences were further explored through hierarchical clustering of the relative abundance of functional categories assigned by the eggNOG database (Fig. 6). Intriguingly, the selected Sphingomonas genomes clustered primarily according to the environment in which they were sampled (terrestrial type strains versus spaceflight-relevant surfaces at KSC and the ISS) and then clustered according to their species assignment. Examining the relative abundance of each of the assigned functional categories, it is clear that a sizeable portion (∼20% to 21%) of each of these selected Sphingomonas genomes lack known functional roles, highlighting novel gene products that are ripe for future bioinformatics and molecular characterization. Yet, differences in functional products corresponding to the category L, replication, recombination, and repair, are noticeably higher in genomes of the strains isolated from spaceflight-relevant surfaces.\n\nProtein-level differences between the Sphingomonas strains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains are shown in Fig. 7A and Table S1. Intersection analysis was performed using UpsetR for the presence and absence of named protein products across each genome (Fig. 7B). Here, 1,488 named proteins were shared among all of the selected spaceflight-relevant Sphingomonas genomes and their respective type strains. In contrast, 71 named orthologous proteins were unique to the S. paucimobilis strains isolated from spaceflight-relevant surfaces, and an analogous 53 named orthologous proteins were found to be unique to S. sanguinis spaceflight strains. However, a sizable portion of the proteomes for each of these genomes lacked predicted protein names to use as unique terms for intersection analysis. Thus, a custom pileup was performed that grouped entries into unique keys consisting of common predicted taxa, predicted protein names, the eggNOG free text description, and their predicted functional category where unnamed proteins could be compared across multiple genomes. While this method enhanced comparisons of unnamed protein groups identified by eggNOGv5, precaution should be taken when comparing the results, as different seed orthologs appear to transfer slightly different descriptions; however, such an analysis greatly improved functional insights that would not have been captured via analysis of KEGG Orthology (KO) or named proteins alone. Analysis of the KO assigned by eggNOGv5 revealed that gene clusters associated with rhamnose metabolism, type IV secretion (trb operon), conjugal transfer pilus assembly proteins (tra operon), and heavy metal resistance genes are present in each of the spaceflight S. sanguinis strains and are notably absent from the type strain S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T. While S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T is not a complete genome, the ability to capture the presence or components of large biosynthetic clusters or operons is conducive to the assemblies’ N50 of 61,922 bp across 134 contigs of total length 4,053,092 bp. Similar patterns of differences in type IV secretion apparatus, conjugal transfer proteins, and rhamnose metabolism were also observed for the spaceflight-relevant surface strains from S. paucimobilis compared to those of their type strains, albeit to a lesser extent than the patterns reported for S. sanguinis. Further unique gene products identified in S. paucimobilis include a suite of multidrug efflux proteins, DNA repair proteins (dinJ and sbcD), catechol metabolism (catABC), genes involved in quorum sensing via homoserine lactone synthesis and export, and the natural transformation protein comEA. Both S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis spaceflight isolates also showed the presence of genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of industrially important metabolites, including antibiotics (erythromycin and vancomycin) and anticancer compounds (betalains). Overall, our results point to functional differences in these spaceflight-relevant S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis genomes compared to their respective type strains, many of which may provide adaptive advantages for survival during spaceflight or on spaceflight-relevant surfaces.",
