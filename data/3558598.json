  "abstract": "Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium which causes the tick-borne disease human monocytic ehrlichiosis. In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis replicates in monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear cell or tissue tropism has been defined in arthropods. Our group identified two host genes that control E. chaffeensis replication and infection in vivo in Drosophila, Uridine cytidine kinase and separation anxiety. Using the UAS-GAL4 RNAi system, we generated F1 flies (UAS-gene of interest RNAi x tissue-GAL4 flies) that have Uck2 or san silenced in ubiquitous or tissue-specific fashion. When Uck2 or san were suppressed in the hemocytes or in the fat body, E. chaffeensis replicated poorly and caused significantly less severe infections. Silencing of these genes in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands did not impact fly susceptibility or bacterial replication. Our data suggest that in Drosophila, E. chaffeensis replicates within the hemocytes, the insect homolog of mammalian macrophages, and in the fat body, the liver homolog of mammals.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nHuman monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is a tick-borne, zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium, Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensis is primarily vectored by Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) and is transmitted transstadially in ticks. A. americanum has a 3-host life cycle. For progression from one stage to the next (larva to nymph to adult), the tick requires a vertebrate blood meal. The major natural reservoir of E. chaffeensis in the United States is white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). However, several other vertebrates, too, act as reservoirs including domestic dog, domestic goat, white-footed mouse, red fox, raccoon, and coyote. Humans can also become accidental hosts when bitten by ticks. In humans, the bacteria are monocytotropic, meaning they are primarily found in monocytes and macrophages, and there is a good understanding of where the bacteria replicate. Although it is clear that ticks can transmit Ehrlichia organisms to vertebrate hosts, and Ehrlichia bacteria have been detected in the salivary glands microscopically and by PCR, it is less clear about bacteria replication in ticks. Although genetic tools for working with ticks are currently being developed, the available tools do not begin to approach those that are available in other arthropods such as Drosophila melanogaster.\n\nIn adult D. melanogaster, hemocytes contribute to host immune defenses against E. chaffeensis. In vertebrates, monocytes and macrophages contribute to host resistance even though the bacteria are monocytotropic. Our group has discovered that D. melanogaster genes, separation anxiety (san) and Uridine cytidine kinase 2 (Uck2), are required for E. chaffeensis infections in flies. Flies carrying mutations in the coding regions of these genes do not support infection after needle injection. Therefore, to see if bacterial replication in arthropods parallels bacterial replication in vertebrates after needle injection, we took advantage of Drosophila UAS-GAL4 RNAi system that allowed for tissue-specific silencing of san and Uck2 to determine host sites of bacterial replication. Here, we show that similar to vertebrate hosts, in Drosophila the bacteria require optimal host conditions (i.e. expression of Uck2 or san) in the immune tissues, hemocytes, and fat body, for optimal replication.",
  "methods": "Materials and methods\n\nCell lines and E. chaffeensis infections\n\nE. chaffeensis (Arkansas isolate) was propagated in DH82 cells (American Type Culture collection, #CRL-10389, Rockville, Md.). The DH82 cells were grown in Eagle’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 3.5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), 3.5% NuSerum (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and Glutamine plus (2 mM, Atlanta Biologicals) (EMEM7). Cells were grown at 37°C in an 8% CO2/92% air atmosphere. The level of infection was determined by examining cyto-centrifuged cells stained with Dif-Quik stain (Fisher Scientific Company, Kalamazoo, MI). When more than 80% of cells were infected, the cells were removed with a cell scraper and frozen at −80°C in cryogenic vials. Bacteria numbers were quantified using a TaqMan-based quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay as described below. Purification of host cell-free bacteria was carried out as follows. Cells were scraped from tissue culture dishes. The recovered infected cells were placed in a 50-ml, sterile centrifuge tube and shaken with glass beads. The preparation was centrifuged at 600 × g for 20 min. The supernatant with host cell-free bacteria was transferred into a sterile tube and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mixed with blue food dye at a ratio of 0.6 ml dye for every 1 ml of PBS to help us visualize the inoculum during fly injections. Most flies were injected with 6000 bacteria per fly, however, some early experiments were done with 1500 bacteria per fly. Although the severity of infections was different with the different inocula, the experimental trends were similar.\n\nD. melanogaster\n\nD. melanogaster flies were raised on standard dextrose/molasses/yeast medium at 18–29°C. The following fly lines were used: yellow white (yw) and arm-GAL4, Hml-GAL4, YP1-GAL4, MS1096-GAL4, Gmr-GAL4, Fhk-GAL4, UAS-Uck2RNAi (w[1118]; P{GD2761}v16719)and UAS-sanRNAi (w[1118]; P{GD7580}v31742). The yw fly line was maintained at Kansas State University and used as a wild type in these experiments. The armadillo (arm)-Gal fly line was obtained from Joan Hooper (University of Colorado, Anchutz Medical campus, Denver, CO). The Fhk-GAL4 and YP1-GAL4 were obtained from Tony Ip (The University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). The Hml-GAL4 fly line was obtained from Michael Galko (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The MS1096 and Gmr-GAL4 fly lines were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN. UAS-dsRNA transgenic fly lines were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC). Five to seven virgin females carrying the GAL4 promoter were crossed with 3–4 males carrying different UAS-dsRNA transgenes to generate F1 flies that had tissue-specific or ubiquitous knockdown of Uck2 or san genes.\n\nRNA extraction\n\nThe TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) RNA extraction method, as was previously described by our group, was used to extract RNA from flies or host cell-free bacteria. Pelleted bacteria or fly homogenates were resuspended in 1 ml of TriReagent. Preparations were transferred to 2.0 ml, Heavy Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 Prime/Eppendorf, Westbury, New York; #2302830). Three hundred microliters (300 μl) of chloroform were added, and the mixture was vortexed for 15 s. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the aqueous phase was transferred to clean 1.5 ml tubes. Five hundred microliters (500 μl) of isopropanol were added, and RNA was precipitated at −20°C for 24 h. Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The RNA pellet was washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol, and samples were centrifuged at 7400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The 70% ethanol was decanted from the pellet, and residual ethanol was allowed to evaporate for 5 min. RNA was resuspended in 50 μl of nuclease-free water. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).\n\nQuantification of bacterial numbers for infection/injection and in infected flies\n\nRNA from host cell-free Ehrlichia was extracted as described above. A TaqMan-based, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantify bacterial numbers. A total of 500–1000 ng of RNA was used for each reaction. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the Invitrogen’s One-Step Platinum qRT-PCR kit (#11732) in a Cepheid Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). E. chaffeensis RNA was detected using primers specific for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (NCBI Accession # M73222). Custom-synthesized primers and probes were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA) and were used. The sequence of the primers used were: forward primer, RRG3 (5′ CAATTGCTTATAACCTTTTGGTTATAAAT 3′) and reverse primer, RRG27 (5′ GTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC3′). Serial 10-fold dilutions of the RNA from infected DH82 cells were used to generate standard curves plotting log number of bacteria versus the corresponding Ct value. The cycling conditions used for the assay were: 48°C for 30 min, 94°C for 4 min, then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. To quantify bacterial numbers in injected/infected flies, anesthetized flies were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes (Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ) and crushed with disposable pestles in 1 ml of TriReagent as previously described. Bacteria numbers were estimated from RNA samples using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) as described above. Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a (NCBI Accession #NM_136772) gene was used as used as housekeeping. The sequence of the primers used were: forward primer (5′ TGGACCACGAGGAGGCTAGG 3′) and reverse primer (5′ GTTGGTGCATGGTCGGTGA 3′) and Taqman probe (5′-56-FAM/TGGGAGGCAAAATTCTCGGCTTC/36-TAMsp-3′). The cycling conditions used for the assay were: 48°C for 45 min, 94°C for 2 min, and then 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1.5 min.\n\nEstimation of silencing efficiency\n\nTo quantify the level of transcriptional silencing in RNAi flies, whole-flies or specific fly tissues were used to probe for specific transcript levels. Fly tissues were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and crushed with disposable pestles in 1 ml of TriReagent for RNA extraction. Transcript levels of the gene of interest in F1 flies were assessed in the following whole-flies: ubiquitous (UAS-sanRNAi X arm-GAL4 or UAS-Uck2RNAi X arm-GAL4); hemocytes (UAS-sanRNAi X Hml-GAL4 or UAS-Uck2RNAi X Hml-GAL4); fat body (UAS-sanRNAi X YP1-GAL4 or UAS-Uck2RNAi X YP1-GAL4). For wing-specific and eye-specific knockdown, fly heads or wings were used. For fat body-specific and salivary gland-specific knockdown, fat body or salivary glands dissected from wandering third-instar larvae were used. RNA from homogenates was extracted as described above. Transcript levels were determined in RNA samples using qRT-PCR using the Invitrogen’s Superscript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit in. Primers were obtained from IDT. Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a was used as used as the housekeeping gene. Drosophila Uck2 (NCBI Accession #NM_142984) was detected using forward primer (5′ TGTCCATCAGTCAGGACAGC 3′) and reverse primer (5′ CTCCACTTTGTGGCCCTTTA 3′). The cycling conditions used for the assay were 48°C for 30 min, 95°C for 3 min, and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 60°C for 1 min. The Drosophila san gene (NCBI Accession # NM_080040) was detected using forward primer (5′ ACCCGAACAATCAGGAACAG 3′) and reverse primer (5′ ACCCGAACAATCAGGAACAG 3′). The cycling conditions used for the assay were 48°C for 30 min, 95°C for 3 min, and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 60°C for 1 min.\n\nTo calculate knockdown efficiency serial 10-fold dilutions of RNA and corresponding Ct values were used to plot standard curves (mean of 3 experiments). Primer efficiency was calculated using the following equation:\n\nPrimer efficiency values were used to calculate the relative change in gene expression by the following equation:\n\nParental lines (UAS and GAL4 constructs) and yw flies served as normal controls and were set at 100% expression for the gene of interest. Relative level of gene expression in RNAi flies as compared to controls was calculated to estimate the knockdown efficiency.\n\nInfections\n\nAdult flies were used to assess the effect of gene knockdown on E. chaffeensis infections. Male and female flies were anesthetized on a CO2 anesthesia pad (Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA; model# 59-119). Flies were injected in the thorax with 51 nl of sterile PBS-blue food dye solution or Ehrlichia resuspended in PBS-blue food dye solution. Injections were made in the abdomen of the fly with pulled glass capillary needles using a Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA). Following injection, flies were maintained in clean bottles with molasses/yeast caps. Survival was monitored daily for 4 days. Twenty flies were injected per treatment group per experiment with 3–4 independent experiments for survival data. Four to five flies were used to determine bacterial infection.\n\nStatistics\n\nSurvival data were analyzed for significance using the log-rank test of Kaplan Meier plots using Prism Graphpad software (La Jolla, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) of independent experiments unless otherwise stated. P values of <0.05 were considered highly significant. Bacterial numbers were analyzed by Student’s t test (two-tailed, general) by using the StatMost Statistical Package (Data XIOM, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Unless indicated, data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) of independent experiments.",
  "results": "Results\n\nUck2 and san are required for in vivo E. chaffeensis replication in adult D. melanogaster\n\nE. chaffeensis is capable of infecting and completing its life cycle in Drosophila S2 cells and adult flies. Recent work by our group found that several host genes control the replication of Ehrlichia in vivo. We found that flies carrying mutations in coding regions of these genes were poorly infected by E. chaffeensis. In particular, 2 genes that are relevant to humans and ticks were chosen for this study, Uck2 and san. Uck2 functions as a uridine-cytidine kinase and is orthologous to the mammalian UCK2 gene and the Ixodes scapularis SCW003812 gene. san is the ortholog to the human NAA50 gene and encodes the N(α)-acetyltransferase 50 protein. It is orthologous to the I. scapularis SCW002560 gene.\n\nIn vertebrates, E. chaffeensis exhibits a tropism for monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear requirements for cell or tissue tropism have been defined in ticks or other arthropods. To investigate where E. chaffeensis replicates in arthropods, we employed whole-organism in vivo RNAi in D. melanogaster to do tissue-specific inactivation of Uck2 and san using a fly collection that consists of expressed RNAi transgenes where the inverted repeats produce a dsRNA hairpin that produces the RNAi effect. These tools allowed us to silence Uck2 and san genes in a tissue-specific manner through the binary GAL4-UAS system to determine what tissues must be permissive (via their expression of Uck2 or san) for E. chaffeensis replication.\n\nTo determine whether Uck2 and san could be efficiently silenced using the UAS-GAL4 system, we individually crossed transgenic flies carrying inverted repeats of the Uck2 and san genes under the control of UAS to flies carrying armadillo (arm)-GAL4 (ubiquitous GAL4 insertions) to silence Uck2 or san in the F1 progeny. We consistently averaged 78% or better transcript reduction of Uck2 or san in the RNAi flies in comparison to wild-type flies and parental lines using qRT-PCR (Table 1). When wild-type flies, parental line flies, and Uck2- and san-RNAi flies were experimentally challenged with E. chaffeensis in the abdomen, we observed that there was approximately 48% death in wild-type and parental lines after 96 h. This rate of death was significantly increased compared to control flies injected with PBS or flies which had ubiquitous tissue expression of Uck2-or san-RNAi (Fig. 1A and 1B) (P<0.05, log rank test). When we assessed the effect of infection on RNAi flies where Uck2 or san were knocked down ubiquitously, we detected significantly fewer bacteria at 96 hpi (P<0.05, t-test) compared to wild-type or parental fly controls (Fig. 2A and 2B). These experiments confirmed that the UAS-GAL4 technique could be used to efficiently silence Uck2 and san in adult flies and that E. chaffeensis infection in flies was dependent on functional Uck2 and san genes.\n\nE. chaffeensis replication in adult D. melanogaster\n\nUbiquitous tissue silencing of Uck2 and san impaired E. chaffeensis infection in adult D. melanogaster. Therefore, we screened an array of tissues to determine if Uck2 or san expression were necessary in those tissues for bacterial replication. In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis exhibits a tropism for monocytes and macrophages. Therefore, we hypothesized that E. chaffeensis replicates in hemocytes, the insect equivalent to mammalian macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we silenced Uck2 and san in the eyes, wings, hemocytes, fat body, and salivary glands in a tissue-specific manner in adult flies. We used eye-specific (Gmr-GAL4), wing-specific (MS1096-GAL4), hemocyte-specific (Hml-GAL4), fat body-specific (YP1-Gal), or salivary gland-specific (Fhk-GAL4) GAL4 fly lines to generate F1 flies. To confirm the tissue-specific knockdown of targeted genes, we dissected whole heads and wings from adult flies to assess eye-specific and wing-specific adult knockdown. We observed an average ≥74% reduction in transcript levels of Uck2 and san in whole heads or wings of F1 transgenic flies using eye- or wing-specific GAL4 constructs (Table 2). In comparison, the average knockdown of Uck2 or san in the whole body minus the respective eyes or wings never averaged >15% knockdown (Table 2). These data confirmed the tissue-specific targeting of both Uck2 and san genes.\n\nWe used whole adult flies to assess hemocyte-specific knockdown using the hemocyte-specific GAL4 line to express Uck2 and san-RNAi transgenes specifically in hemocytes. We found that RNA levels were reduced by an average of 79±6% and 62±4%, respectively, when compared to experimental controls (Table 1). Because the Hml-Gal4 line is highly specific for expression in the hemocytes, we can reasonably assume that the reduction in RNA levels in these whole flies is due to specific knockdown of the transcript in hemocytes and not other tissues. The fat body and salivary glands are difficult to dissect from adult flies. Since the RNAi effect is applicable at all stages of the Drosophila lifespan, we isolated the fat bodies and salivary glands from 3rd instar larvae to assess the silencing efficiency specifically in the fat body and salivary glands of our RNAi flies. In the dissected fat body from fat body-specific Uck2 and san-RNAi third instar larvae, there was an average of 77±8% and 66±12% reduction in transcript levels, respectively, compared to dissected fat body from 3rd instar control larvae from wild-type or parental flies (Table 1). Similarly, transcript levels in dissected salivary glands from salivary gland-specific Uck2 and san-RNAi 3rd instar larvae showed that RNA levels were reduced >90% in comparison to dissected salivary glands from control larvae from wild-type or parental flies (Table 2). In contrast, there was <29% knockdown of san or Uck2 in RNA samples extracted from non-salivary gland tissue isolated from 3rd instar larvae in comparison to non-salivary gland tissue from control larvae from wild-type or parental flies (Table 2).\n\nAfter confirming tissue-specific RNAi silencing effect of Uck2 and san, control and RNAi flies were experimentally challenged with E. chaffeensis. We observed that eye- (Fig. 3A and 3B), salivary gland- (Fig. 3C and 3D), and wing- (Fig. 3E and 3F) specific knockdown of Uck2 and san did not impact fly survival. These RNAi flies were as susceptible to E. chaffeensis infection as wild-type and parental controls (Fig. 3; P>0.05, log-rank tests). In contrast, hemocyte- and fat body-specific Uck2- (Fig. 4A and 4C)and san- (Fig. 4B and 4D) RNAi flies survived significantly better (P<0.05, log-rank test) than the control flies after infection with Ehrlichia (Fig. 4A–D). Ninety-six hours after infection, >80% of hemocyte-specific Uck2-RNAi and San-RNAi flies survived in comparison to an average of 50% of wild-type and parental control flies. When we assessed F1 RNAi flies for bacteria load, there were no differences in bacteria number in eye-specific (Fig. 5A and 5B), salivary gland-specific (Fig. 5C and 5D), and wing-specific (Fig. 5E and 5F) Uck2 and san F1 RNAi flies compared to control flies (P>0.05, t-test). However, F1 RNAi flies with hemocyte-specific (Fig. 6A and 6B) or fat body-specific (Fig. 6C and 6D) knockdown of Uck2 or san had significantly fewer bacteria (P<0.05, t-test). At the 96-h time point, there were greater than 95% fewer bacteria in hemocyte-specific (Fig. 6A and 6B) or fat body-specific (Fig. 6C and 6D) Uck2- or san-RNAi flies, respectively, compared to controls.",
