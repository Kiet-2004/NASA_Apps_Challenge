  "introduction": "Before you begin\n\nExperimental design and considerations\n\nNote: This protocol utilizes skeletal muscle tissue from research animals and human cohorts. Ensure that the use of research animals has been approved by the appropriate institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) or equivalent oversight body. Additionally, procurement and use of tissues derived from human sources should follow the appropriate organizational rules regarding informed consent and be approved by the end user’s institutional review board. Sample collection for this protocol was done according to institutional guidelines and regulations of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nNote: For telomere data extraction from images, the following software must be installed on the analysis computer: java se (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and the freeware Telometer (https://demarzolab.pathology.jhmi.edu/telometer/download.html). Install software according to instructions listed on the websites.\n\nReductions in telomere length in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) have been recently discovered in chronic muscle injury conditions, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which results in a more severe disease phenotype. Many common methods for conducting telomere length assessments in other cell and tissue types requires the isolation of primary cells, which may disrupt the tissue environment, requires large numbers of cells to obtain enough genomic DNA for appraisal [Telomere Restriction Fragment/TRF analysis ], or only provides the average telomere length over the entirety of the cell population [Telomere:single copy gene QPCR methodology ] . The quantitative fluorescent in-situ hybridization (Q-FISH) technique, which allows for assessment of telomere length based on the fluorescence intensity of a hybridized probe, coupled with semi-automated telomere length assessments using a free software (Telometer), provides robust information that can eliminate such limitations. Here, we provide a protocol where our previously established and validated muscle stem cell-specific Q-FISH protocol for measuring telomeres in FACS-isolated MuSCs [MuQ-FISH ], has been altered and adapted for use on cryosections of murine skeletal muscle (CRYO MuQ-FISH), leaving the MuSC niche intact. This method can be beneficial for telomere length quantitation of archival samples and may also be adapted to examine telomere lengths in additional muscle-resident cell types, as well as cell types from other tissues. This protocol is also compatible with skeletal muscle cryosections derived from species other than mice but testing and optimization should be conducted by the end user.\n\nThis protocol includes the following steps: 1) Skeletal muscle preparation, embedding, sectioning, 2) CRYO MuQ-FISH, 3) image collection, 4) analysis and statistics\n\nSkeletal muscle preparation, embedding, and sectioning\n\nTiming: 2 days\n\nHumanely euthanize mice according to an approved IACUC protocol methodology and institutional guidelines.\n\nNote: This protocol uses male mice between 2 and 5 months of age. However, this protocol can be applied to samples derived from other ages and both sexes of mice.\n\nSpray the lower half of mouse body with 70% ethanol.\n\nLay mouse on its back and completely remove skin from the back legs.\n\nDissect desired hindlimb skeletal muscles for assessment.\n\nNote: For downstream assessments, it is ideal to compare the same types of muscles, rather than mixing different anatomical groups. We routinely utilize either the Tibialis anterior or the gastrocnemius muscles for telomere length measurements.\n\nPlace isolated muscles in 3–4 mL of cold (4°C) 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS per well in a 6-well plate.\n\nNote: Tibialis anterior muscles up to 200 mg are fixed for 2 h, but larger muscles, such as the gastrocnemius, require a 3-h incubation for fixative to fully enter the tissue.\n\nIncubate tissue on a rocker at 4°C for at least 2 h.\n\nRemove muscles and place in pre-chilled 30% sucrose in water (4°C) overnight (16 h) at 4°C.\n\nFix and process tissues for embedding.\n\nLabel 15 mm × 15 mm × 5 mm base molds with pertinent mouse information with an alcohol resistant marker and mark directionality of the muscle by labeling the terminal tendon location.\n\nFill base mold with O.C.T. to the point where it almost overflows from the inset. Do not allow bubbles to form. If they do, use a 100 μL micropipettor and tip to remove the bubbles.\n\nPlace fixed muscle tissue in the base mold and push it evenly to the bottom of the mold. The orientation should be as it was labeled previously.\n\nChill 2-methylbutane with dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Immerse muscles in base molds in chilled 2-methylbutane for >30 s for TA muscles and >1 min for gastrocnemius muscles.\n\nPlace chilled blocks on dry ice for 1 h to allow residual 2-methylbutane to evaporate.\n\nWrap blocks in base molds with parafilm and store at −80°C for at least overnight (16 h).\n\nEmbed tissues in O.C.T. and freeze.\n\nPause point: Cryoblocks can be stored at −80°C indefinitely.\n\nThe evening before cryosectioning, remove cryoblocks from −80°C and place at −20°C.\n\nLabel superfrost plus slides with pertinent mouse information.\n\nNote: For optimal adherence of sections, we firmly press cut sections onto room temperature (25°C) superfrost plus slides.\n\nRemove block from base mold and section in a cryostat, cutting 10 μm slices. We try to keep the tissue orientation the same for all blocks. Both longitudinal, as well as cross sectional slices will work with this assay.\n\nStore slides at −20°C until all samples have been collected and sectioned.\n\nSectioning of skeletal muscles.\n\nPause point: Slides can be stored at −20°C indefinitely.",

Common equipment such as freezers, refrigerators, rockers, water baths, steamers, and thermomixers are interchangeable with any other brand and model. Any widefield microscope equipped with the proper filter sets and a 100× objective can complete the imaging described in this protocol.\n\nThe following equipment was used for the described protocol.\n\nSoftware\n\nJava SE 11 or later\n\nTelometer v3.0.5\n\nMicrosoft Excel 365 or equivalent\n\nGraphpad prism 9.1.2 or later\n\nThe following software are instrumental in analysis of datasets generated using this protocol.\n\nStep-by-step method details\n\nTelomere, centromere, muscle stem cell, and nuclear staining\n\nTiming: 2 days\n\nRemove one slide from each desired sample set from −20°C and warm to room temperature (25°C).\n\nPermeabilize sections by immersing slides in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min in a coplin jar at room temperature (25°C).\n\nNote: The coplin jar used in this protocol holds approximately 50 mL of solution and 8 slides. If more slides must be stained, we recommend using a tissue-tek staining dish and 24-place slide holder. This alternative setup requires 200–250 mL of solution volume for adequate coverage of the slides.\n\nWash slides twice with PBS for 3 min each at room temperature (25°C).\n\nHeat buffer to boiling in a microwave first and then transfer buffer to a coplin jar placed in a preheated steamer (95°–100°C).\n\nNote: Take care when handling hot solutions.\n\nCRITICAL: Do not let the slides dry at any time following antigen retrieval, as doing so greatly increases autofluorescence of the tissue and will make distinguishing MuSCs difficult.\n\nAdd slides to the coplin jar containing hot TET buffer (95°–100°C) and incubate for 10 min. Remove coplin jar containing the slides from the steamer and let it cool at room temperature (25°C) for 15 min.\n\nWash slides with PBS twice for 3 min each in a coplin jar at room temperature (25°C).\n\nPerform heat-mediated antigen retrieval with TET buffer.\n\nRemove slides from coplin jar and mark tissue boundaries with a hydrophobic/PAP pen.\n\nCRITICAL: RNase should be DNase-free. We routinely prepare RNase stock concentrations of 10 mg/mL, heat at 100°C for 10 min to destroy DNAses and then dilute to 100ug/mL in water and store at −20°C.\n\nAdd sufficient RNase A (100 μg/mL) to cover tissue on the slide (100–200 μL) and cover the slide with a glass coverslip to prevent evaporation.\n\nIncubate slides at 37°C in a slide warmer or alternative heating source for 20 min.\n\nRemove coverslip and transfer slides into coplin jars containing PBS. Wash slides twice for 3 min each at room temperature (25°C).\n\nRNAse A treatment\n\nNote: The hybridization buffer requires extensive vortexing and pipetting to get all components completely into solution. Heating or alteration of pH is unnecessary. When all components are properly dissolved, the solution will be viscous.\n\nPrepare hybridization buffer [adapted from ] as described in the materials and equipment section.\n\nDilute 5 nmol probe pellet provided by the supplier with 100uL formamide.\n\nNote: Probe is light sensitive. All steps proceeding the addition of probe should be done in the dark or low-light conditions.\n\nNote: Probes stored at −80°C are stable for at least several months.\n\nNote: We recommend using the Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated telomere probe, as it provides the least background in skeletal muscle cryosections.\n\nAliquot in 4 μL aliquots in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80°C.\n\nPrepare TelC-Alexa Fluor 647 telomere probe and optional Cy3-CENPB centromere probe.\n\nOptional: Centromere probe staining and analysis is not required, unless problems arise with abnormal nuclear architecture or DAPI staining intensities between samples. If centromere probe staining is desired, use Cy3-CENPB probe at 1/600 dilution and add it at the same time as the telomere probe above. The CENPB probe is prepared identically to the telomere probe.\n\nRemove telomere probe from −80°C storage, thaw, and add probe at a 1/600 dilution to the hybridization buffer (1.67 μL/mL of buffer).\n\nHeat probe(s) in hybridization buffer for 10 min at 67°C in a thermomixer or alternative heating source in the dark.\n\nCRITICAL: It is crucial that bubbles are kept to a minimum, as areas that are not evenly covered will not stain properly.\n\nAdd hybridization buffer containing probe to slides. We typically use 100 μL probe solution per slide. Cover slides with a glass coverslip to prevent evaporation during incubation.\n\nIncubate slides in a Thermobrite slide warmer or equivalent heating source, according to Table 1.\n\nPreheat wash buffers I, II, III, IV to 55°C in a water bath or equivalent heating source.\n\nGently remove coverslips from slides after hybridization, place slides in coplin jars, and incubate with 50 mL prewarmed wash buffer I for 5 min. Keep coplin jar at 55°C during the wash process. Repeat wash once.\n\nContinue washing stepwise with 2 washes each (50 mL per wash) of wash buffer II, wash buffer III, and wash buffer IV, in that order, for 5 min each wash and at 55°C.\n\nWash slides once with PBS for 5 min at room temperature (25°C).\n\nTelomere Staining\n\nBlock sections in 50 mL antibody blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature (25°C).\n\nIncubate slides in cold (4°C) blocking buffer with VCAM antibody (1/100 dilution); stock antibody concentration 1 mg/mL, in a dark, humidified staining chamber overnight (16 h) at 4°C. We use 100 μL of antibody solution per slide. Cover slides with a coverslip to ensure even coverage of antibody solution.\n\nWash slides the following day in coplin jars with 50 mL PBS, twice, 5 min each at room temperature (25°C).\n\nIncubate sections for 1 h with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey anti-goat IgG; 1/300 dilution) in antibody blocking buffer at room temperature (25°C). We use 100 μL of antibody solution per slide. Cover slides with a coverslip to ensure even coverage of antibody solution.\n\nWash slides three times for 5 min each with PBS at room temperature (25°C). PBS washes are carried out in coplin jars and using 50 mL of solution.\n\nMount coverslips with Prolong gold with DAPI.\n\nAllow mounting media to solidify overnight (16 h) at room temperature (25°C) in the dark.\n\nMuscle Stem Cell Staining\n\nImage acquisition\n\nTiming: less than 3 days\n\nCRITICAL: The imaging must take place as soon as possible after staining, and imaging must be completed for all samples in as short a period of time as possible. Given the sensitivity of Q-FISH assays, minor changes in fluorescence intensities can result in skewed datasets. Even with antifade agents in the mounting medium, it is imperative to image cells of interest as quickly as possible, so we recommend completing imaging of all samples in 3 days or less.\n\nNote: Any widefield epifluorescence microscope with appropriate objectives, filters, and camera should be capable of completing this assay.\n\nNote: While VCAM1 is a good marker of MuSCs, it may also label other cells, such as endothelial cells. To prevent selecting the wrong cell types during image acquisition and analysis, we only image MuSCs in the satellite cell position (between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma). Additionally, staining with other non-muscle markers such as CD31 and CD45 (as described in) could be performed to exclude such populations from the analysis.\n\nIdentify VCAM+ cells (Alexa Fluor 488+) with a low power air objective (i.e., Nikon plan fluor 10×/0.30 objective).\n\nSwitch to a higher-powered 100× objective (i.e., Nikon plan apo100×/1.45 oil) for actual imaging and photographing cells of interest.\n\nIdentify VCAM+ cells present in tissue sections using a Nikon Eclipse NiU widefield epifluorescence microscope.\n\nIdentify the optimal exposure settings for DAPI, telomere Alexa Fluor 647 signal, and optional centromere Cy3 imaging. Troubleshooting 1, Troubleshooting 2\n\nNote: Several slides should be examined before determining the optimal exposure settings. It is undesirable to have oversaturated or undersaturated pixels in any of the images. In either situation, fewer regions of interest are identified.\n\nCRITICAL: Once intensity settings are determined, the exposure settings should not be changed for the duration of the particular experiment.\n\nIdentify focal planes containing the most telomere signals for every cell of interest.\n\nA minimum of 35 VCAM+ cells should be imaged per biological sample.\n\nSave multichannel images in raw file formats to maintain metadata. For Nikon Elements software, this is a .nd2 file.\n\nImage as many cells as possible during scheduled equipment usage hours from the biological samples. Troubleshooting 3\n\nProceed with multichannel imaging of VCAM, DAPI, telomere, and optional centromere signals (Figure 1).\n\nOptional: Obtaining z-stacks and flattening with an extended depth of focus algorithm will provide more telomere and optional centromere foci per cell, but a single focal plane with many foci in focus is sufficient to yield useable data for analysis.\n\nNote: Imaging more VCAM+ cells will produce a better representation of the population of MuSCs throughout the muscle. Ensure that more than one muscle section is examined per slide.\n\nNote: If imaging of all desired cells from all samples cannot be completed in one day, stagger the genotypes/treatments during imaging to ensure fading that occurs between imaging sessions will be similar between the groups.\n\nNote: It is best to avoid imaging/assessing cells of interest that are positioned on top of or below other cells/nuclei, as telomere length quantitated from overlapping cells may confound the datasets.\n\nEach channel should be first exported as grayscale/monochrome 16-bit .tiff images for analysis.\n\nA merged 8-bit color .tiff image is also exported to identify cells of interest (VCAM+) for later analysis.\n\nExport raw image files in two groups.\n\nPause point: After all needed images are collected, downstream analysis can be conducted at the end user’s leisure.\n\nCryosection MuSC-fluorescent in situ hybridization (CRYO MuQ-FISH) telomere length data collection and analysis\n\nTiming: varies based on sample size. Several hours to several days.\n\nOpen Telometer software and create a new project in the “Admin” tab (Figure 2A).\n\nClick the “Score” tab and follow the on-screen instructions for each step.\n\nSelect the Project name for your analysis grouping and the Preset objective (in this case 100× telomere) and subtract Cy3 background. The scoring tag adds metadata to the analysis. We do not usually alter this.\n\nSelect the Telomere 16-bit monochrome exported tiff image when prompted for opening the first image.\n\nNote: Telometer defaults as the telomere signal being a Cy3 image. In this protocol, the telomere image is the Alexa Fluor 647 channel image, and it is this image that is opened first when prompted.\n\nNext, open the DAPI 16-bit monochrome exported tiff image when prompted.\n\nNormalize the Telomere image by clicking and forming a box of any size in an area absent of features and click “normalize” (Figure 2B).\n\nRepeat normalization for the DAPI image when prompted (Figure 2C).\n\nContinue following software prompts for creating masked images to narrow down regions in the image that contain telomere foci.\n\nThreshold the masked image, if necessary, when prompted to obtain the greatest telomere foci in the image with the least background (Figure 2D).\n\nNote: The Telometer software typically does a decent job with auto-thresholding, so the investigator does not often need to further threshold.\n\nManually draw a circle encompassing a nucleus of interest when prompted. Refer to the color image to determine which nuclei are clearly VCAM+ and designate the nucleus of interest. Selection of VCAM nuclei should only occur for cells in the satellite cell position (between the basal lamina and sarcolemma). Name the nucleus as desired (Figure 2E).\n\nSelect the “+ Add Nucleus” button. Repeat for additional VCAM+ cells in the image, if any. Click the “next” button (Figure 2F).\n\nOptional: Telometer next gives the option to separate conjoined telomere foci (if counting telomere number) and manually remove halo artifacts from out of focus light. These functions are completely optional for the analysis.\n\nSelect “complete.” The data will be stored on your local machine. To view images at a later time that have been processed and analyzed, select the “View” option in the Telometer tab (Figure 2G).\n\nRepeat step 15–23 for remaining images to analyze. Ensure that they are being saved in the proper project data file and appropriately named.\n\nIn the “Export” tab of Telometer, select the project name for data export.\n\nClick the “Scoring” button that has an arrow.\n\nSelect all data under “Scorings” and click the “Cells” button that has an arrow.\n\nSelect all data under “Cells” and copy and paste into Excel or other spreadsheet software. Ensure that you also note the headings for each column. Troubleshooting 4\n\nExport data to copy into excel (Figure 2H).\n\nTo analyze datasets using the Telomere sum option, refer to the last column of the dataset. It represents the telomere sum intensity divided by DAPI sum intensity formula∗100.\n\nOptional: If telomere mean intensities are desired per cell instead of total (sum) intensities, calculate this value by dividing the datasets in the Telomere Mean column by its respective DAPI Sum.\n\nOptional: If one desires to normalize to centromere intensity instead of DAPI intensity, the procedure for telomere analysis is repeated, but instead of using the Telomere images on prompt to open, the centromere images are opened instead. The nuclei should be named and selected similarly in the same order as the telomere analysis. Then the last column of data from the telomere analysis is divided by the last column of centromere data analysis. Troubleshooting 5\n\nGraph datasets as desired in Graphpad prism. Data can be graphed as total intensity values, or data can be graphed as histograms to demonstrate minor shifts of telomere length within the populations (Figure 3). Troubleshooting 6\n\nNote: The telomere and centromere probes are probes that recognize mammalian DNA sequences and are functional in other species, including samples from rat and human. We have found that this protocol is compatible with muscle tissues of human and rat skeletal muscle cryosections (Figures 4 and 5). We also examined the adaptability of this protocol to several other tissue types (spleen, liver, kidney, testicle, and colon) and found this protocol does appropriately label telomeres in all tissues examined (Figure 5), increasing the impact and usability of this method. However, in such tissues, it may be necessary to utilize thinner sections or more advanced microscopes (confocal microscopy), given the increased number of focal planes exhibiting telomere foci observed.\n\nTelomere length is measured using a semi-automated ImageJ-based platform known as Telometer. Telometer provides step-by step instructions to analyze 16-bit monochrome images for telomere length. The premise involves creating a project that is saved on a local machine, identifying cells of interest, and measuring the intensity of telomeres, relative to the total DAPI intensity of that cell. The readout from Telometer produces both total sum intensity of telomeres, which can be normalized to DAPI intensity to account for differences in cell cycle position, as well as the mean intensity of telomeres, which can also be normalized to DAPI. Should nuclear architecture or staining be compromised, telomere measurements can instead be normalized to centromere intensities. In this fashion, Telometer steps are conducted twice. Once, where the telomere signal is assessed relative to DAPI, and then those same cells of interest are analyzed a second time, where the centromere intensities are measured instead of the telomere intensities. The ratio of these measurements would then be used for dataset readouts.\n\nExpected outcomes\n\nThis protocol demonstrates the methodology to process cryosections of skeletal muscle for telomere analysis. We utilized VCAM as a muscle stem cell marker; however, this protocol can likely be applied to additional resident skeletal muscle populations, once appropriate markers are identified and tested for compatibility. Here, we utilized data from two different genotypes of mice that underwent chronic, repetitive injuries, to demonstrate different ways to represent the data (Figure 3). Additionally, to confirm the validity of the CRYO MuQ-FISH method, we compared CRYO MuQ-FISH with our traditional MuQ-FISH method using isolated MuSCs. We found similar pattens of telomere shortening in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy coupled with a telomere defect (Figure 6).\n\nQuantification and statistical analysis\n\nComparisons of data between genotypes are conducted using unpaired student T-tests with Welch’s correction. Cells from at 3 mice or samples per experimental condition should be examined, with at least 35 cells imaged per mouse.",
