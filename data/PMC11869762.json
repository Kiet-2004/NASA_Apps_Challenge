  "abstract": "Background\n\nDuring medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health.

This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity.\n\nMethods\n\nA hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using RNA-Seq. RT-PCR was performed to further focus and verify these results. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further analyzed.\n\nResults\n\nWe found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation. The underlying mechanism may be related to the “intestinal immune -microbiota-metabolic” pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the precise design and development of GTSs for space-health products.\n\nGraphical Abstract",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nLong-duration spaceflight missions face challenges due to a variety of factors, including high vacuum, intense radiation, and low magnitude of gravity. Microgravity exposure is the main difficulty that needs to be overcome in real time, which causes astronauts to be in sub-health for a long time, affecting flight tasks and physical fitness. Several studies have shown that microgravity is closely related to health problems such as immune system disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction, and skeletal muscle loss. Intestinal microecology plays an important role in mediating the decline in these functions. Under weightlessness conditions, the intestine directly suffers from structural damage caused by various stress factors, including disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiota imbalance. Moreover, the gut also regulates immune function and affects signal transduction between the host and intestinal microorganisms by producing intestinal microbial metabolites such as SCFAs. Evidence from animal experiments has reported serious intestinal barrier damage under weightlessness simulation, including typical intestinal villi injury, downregulation of tight junction protein expression, cell apoptosis, and increased intestinal permeability. Similarly, shortened intestinal villi, shallower crypt depth, and reduced mucin production in intestinal epithelial cells were observed in spaceflight rats. Recent data also show that the fluctuation of intestinal flora caused by weightlessness will lead to the imbalance of the immune system and increase the risk of opportunistic infection. A study revealed that weightlessness caused change in the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes, which may lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines by activating pattern recognition receptors. In addition, microbiota metabolites also participate in the pathological changes of the digestive system related to spaceflight stress and play a role in the body signal transduction. Evidence shows that long-duration space flight significantly changes the gastrointestinal microbiota and related microbial metabolites of astronauts. The exploration based on animal experiments has also identified changes in intestinal metabolome such as amino acids and short-chain fatty acids, which are related to immune dysfunction and intestinal flora disorders. Thus, it is necessary to monitor intestinal microecological disorders caused by weightlessness and to discover related protective strategies to ensure the health of astronauts.\n\nIn recent years, natural ingredients derived from plants or food, with the advantages of mild antibacterial activity, reparative action, and low resistance to human drugs, have shown broad application prospects in regulating the intestinal microecological balance. As a perennial plant with homology of medicine and food, ginseng has been used for thousands of years in many countries to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), a bioactive compound in ginseng, is responsible for most of the immunological and pharmacological activities of ginseng. According to previous records, GTSs have health benefits in regulating intestinal homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-central nervous system diseases, and in maintaining immunity. In particular, the effects of GTSs on intestinal immune regulation and inhibition of inflammation have been confirmed. GTSs are also beneficial for increasing the diversity of the gut microbiota, enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides) and reducing the production of pathogenic bacteria (iron-removing bacteria, Helicobacter pylori) to enhance host health. In addition, the monomeric constituents of ginseng (including ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, Rk3, and Re) can remodel the composition of the intestinal flora or modulate flora metabolites, thereby causing different effects on the intestinal barrier function, immune function, and host homeostasis.\n\nBecause of its beneficial effects, CHM Taikong Yangxin prescription, which contains ginseng, has been used to keep Chinese astronauts healthy during their flights. In a previous study, we explored the potential of GTSs to maintain the neurological subhealth of astronauts. However, the regulatory effect of ginseng on intestinal homeostasis under weightlessness conditions remains unclear, and the underlying mechanisms related to gut-brain interactions remain to be explored. Therefore, we used the hindlimb suspension (HLS) model to evaluate the potential and possible mechanisms of GTSs in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, which will help to expand the health effects of ginseng and provide novel understanding and treatment options for health problems, starting with intestinal homeostasis during space travel.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nReagents and Chemicals\n\nThe GTSs, prepared according to previously published methods, were provided by the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Ginsenosides Rb1 (Cat no. RM0502), Rb2 (Cat no. RM0503), Rg1 (Cat no. RM0509), Rg2 (Cat no. RM0510), Rc (Cat no. RM0505), Rd (Cat no. RM0506), Re (Cat no. RM0507), and Rf (Cat no. RM0508) were obtained from RefMedic (Sichuan, China). TNF-α (Cat no. 1317202) and IL-6 (Cat no. 1310602) ELISA kits were bought from Dakewei Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China).\n\nAnti-occludin (Cat no. 27260-1-AP) and anti-claudin-1 (Cat no. 28674-1-AP) antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Cat no. SA00001-2), GAPDH (Cat no. 10494-1-AP) were obtained from proteintech (Wuhan, China).\n\nAcetic acids (Cat no. A298827), propionic acids (Cat no. P110446), butyric acids (Cat no. B110440), and isobutyric acids (Cat no. B1103522) were obtained from Aladdin Scientific (Shanghai, China).\n\nAnimals\n\nSpecific pathogen-free male Wistar rats (200±20 g) were purchased from Beijing Charles River Experimental Animal Company [SCXK (Beijing, China) 2016–0006]. The animals were kept at a 12 h light/dark cycle environment with a humidity of 45–50% to acclimate for 5 days. All experiments were conducted according to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication No.86–23, revised in 1996) and approved by the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Animal Care and Use Committee [SYXK (Beijing, China) 2017–0020].\n\nHLS Model\n\nRats were randomly divided into three groups (n=6): control (CON), hindlimb suspension (HLS), and the HLS treated with GTSs. The HLS model was established based on previous reports. Briefly, the hindlimbs were attached to a separate device with tape and chain hooks to form a 30-degree head-down tilt for 28 days. The CON and HLS groups were administered the same volume of water or GTSs (200 mg/kg, ig) daily. Subsequently, feces were collected for 16s rDNA sequencing on day 25, and serum and intestinal tissues were collected for other analyses on the last day.\n\nQualitative Analysis of Components in GTSs\n\nUltra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization source and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS), which contained an AB Sciex LC-MS system QTRAP® 6500, was used for separation and quantification. The samples were eluted using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH Shield RP18 column (2.1 mm×50 mm, 1.7 µm particles). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (acetonitrile) and ran under the following program: 0~5 min, 10%~23% B; 5~15 min, 23%~35% B; 15~20 min, 35~48% B; 20~20.5 min, 48%~90% B; 20.5~21.5 min, 90% B; 21.5~23 min, 90%~10% B; 23~25 min, 10% B. The flow rate was set at 0.3mL/min, and the injection volume was 5μL. The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C, and the samples were stored at 4 °C throughout the analysis. Electrospray ion source (ESI) and MRM were performed in the negative mode using nitrogen as the drying agent. The curtain gas (N2) was 40 psi, the collision gas (N2) was 9 psi, and the spray voltage was 5500 V. The atomization temperature was 550 °C, atomization gas (ion source gas 1, N2) and auxiliary gas (ion source gas 2, N2) were used. N2) were both at 55 psi. The corresponding ion pairs and cone voltages are listed in Table S1.\n\nHistological Examination\n\nFresh small intestinal tissue from the same part was rinsed with normal saline and fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution until analysis. H&E and AB-PAS staining were performed to observe the tissue pathology, inflammatory responses, and goblet cell hyperplasia.\n\nFlow Cytometry Analysis\n\nMesenteric lymph nodes were prepared as single-cell suspensions and subsequently incubated with anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD4-APC, anti-CD8-PE, and anti-CD45-APC antibodies (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained cells were analyzed using a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA).\n\nReal-Time PCR\n\nGene expression levels were measured by real-time PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from small intestinal tissue and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The primers used are listed in Table S2. Data were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method with GAPDH as the internal reference for normalization.\n\nTranscriptome Analysis of Small Intestinal Tissue\n\nSmall intestine sections were collected from the Con and HLS groups and transcriptome sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq sequencer by Beijing Boyun Huakang Gene Technology Co., Ltd. Raw data from transcriptomic experiments were deposited in the NCBI SRA database (BioProject ID: PRJNA944741). The raw reads were filtered, and the clean reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (rn6) using HISAT software. Gene expression was quantified by fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped values (FPKM), and the PossionDis algorithm was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log2(fold change) ≥1 and q value ≤0.001). DEGs were then subjected to GO functional annotation. RT-PCR analysis was performed to further screen the DEGs regulated by the GTSs. Primer sequences used are listed in Table S2.\n\nGut Microbiota Structural Profiling\n\nTotal DNA was isolated from rat fecal pellets by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Briefly, 1% agarose gel was used to monitor DNA concentration and purity. According to the concentration, DNA was diluted to 1 ng/μL by adding sterile water. MiSeq systems based on 16S rRNA genes were used to analyze the gut microbiota. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify specific V3-V4 variable regions using barcode and high-frequency primers. A agarose gel electrophoresis (2%) and AxyPrepDNA (Axygen Scientific Inc. USA) gel recovery kit was used to detect PCR products and recover PCR fragments. According to the preliminary electrophoresis results, QuantiFluor™-ST blue fluorescence quantitative system (Promega Company) was utilized to detect and quantify the products of PCR amplification. The samples were mixed in equal proportions and subjected to the Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA) to construct the libraries. The library was sequenced on a computer following a quality check performed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and a qubit. Raw data from 16S rRNA experiments were deposited in the NCBI SRA database (BioProject ID: PRJNA941119).\n\nThe library was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end reads from the original DNA fragments were merged using FLASH software. The sequences were analyzed using UPARSE Version 7.0, with the UPARSE-OTU and UPARSE-out ref algorithms. In-house Perl scripts were used to analyze the diversity values of alpha (within samples) and beta (among samples). An in-house Perl program was used to assign sequences to the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs).\n\nSCFAs Analysis\n\nQuantitative analyses were performed as previously described by our group. The fecal sample (~10 mg) was thawed on ice and 200 µL of 50% methanol was added to prepare the homogenate. After centrifugation (4°C13,000 rpm, 10 min), 8 µL of the supernatant was collected. 50% methanol (72 µL), 1M EDC (10 µL), 1M O-BHA (10 µL), and 500 nM Acetic Acid-1-13C (5 µL; IS) were mixed with the supernatant. Derivatization was performed at 25 °C for 1h. Subsequently, 600 µL dichloromethane was added for extraction and 400 µL of the lower organic phase was collected and dried at 37 °C. Finally, 200 µL of 50% methanol was added to the sample, re-dissolved, and centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was used to re-dissolve the sample. The supernatant was used for LC-MS analysis (AB Sciex LC-MS System QTRAP® 6500).\n\nChromatographic separation was achieved using an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1mm×100mm, 1.8 µm) at 50°C with a typical flow rate (200 nL/min). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and isopropanol (solvent B). The linear gradient was set as follows: 85%–85% A (0.0 to 1.0 min), 85%–64% A (1.0 to 8.0 min), 64%–50% A (8.0 to 8.5 min), 50%–50% A (8.5 to 10.5 min), and 50%–85% A (10.5 to 15 min). Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed in the positive ion mode with an electrospray ion source (ESI) and MRM mode using nitrogen as the drying agent. The curtain gas (N2) was 35 psi, collision gas (N2) was 9 psi, and the spray voltage was 4500 V. The measured parameters for specific ion pairs are listed in Table S3.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAll data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA, USA). Significant differences of multiple groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett post-hoc test or Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
  "results": "Results\n\nThe Content of Eight Ginsenosides in GTSs Was Detected by UPLC-MS\n\nThe MRM chromatograms of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rg1, Rg2, Rc, Rd, Re, and Rf from GTSs were optimized for quantitative analysis. The calibration curve of the eight compounds showed good linearity with the available standards (R2 > 0.99), and the lower limits of quantification for the ginsenosides ranged from 2.4414 to 312.5 ng/mL, indicating sufficient sensitivity for quantitative evaluation. As a result, It contained 258.89 mg/g Rb1, 65.77 mg/g Rb2, 12.87 mg/gRg1, 26.14 mg/g Rg2, 93.72 mg/g Rc, 90.90 mg/g Rd, 105.34 mg/g Re and 20.87 mg/g Rf (Figure S1).\n\nEffect of GTSs on Intestinal Injury of Simulated Weightlessness Rats\n\nAs shown in Figure 1A, pathological analysis was performed to observe tissue damage. Compared to the CON group, obvious pathological damage occurred in the small intestine tissue of the HLS group, including typical small bowel villous atrophy, crypt inflammation, crypt dropout and crypt atrophy. However, GTSs effectively improved the villi/crypt ratio (Figure 1B) and alleviated the impaired intestinal symptoms.Mucin secreted by goblet cells is the first line of innate host defence. To confirm intestinal injury, we performed AB/PAS staining to evaluate the number of goblet cells (Figure 1A). In this study, significant goblet cell depletion and mucin reduction were observed in HLS group, which were reversed to varying degrees after GTSs treatment (Figure 1C and D).\n\nSimilarly, occludin and claudin, which are typical markers of tight junctions, were regulated by GTSs, were significantly increased after GTSs treatment (Figure 2A and B). The proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells was significantly lower in the HLS group than that in the CON group, whereas the proportion of CD3+CD8+ T cells tended to increase (Figure 2C). GTSs regulated these changes close to normal levels, indicating that GTSs effectively restored the intestinal immune imbalance.\n\nCytokines are capable of mediating intestinal immunity and epithelial crosstalk. RT-PCR was performed to determine the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-7. The contents of TNF-α and IL-6 in small intestine were analyzed by ELISA kit. As shown in Figure 2D–E, GTSs treatment reduced the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in the HLS group. In conclusion, GTSs had a positive protective effect in rats with simulated weightlessness.\n\nEffects of Simulated Weightlessness and GTSs on Gut Function\n\nThe small intestines of six rats were performed transcriptome in CON and HLS groups. Compared with the CON group, 660 genes were upregulated and 70 genes were downregulated in the HLS group. GO function enrichment analysis was performed to understand the biological processes of DEGs (Figure 3A). The results revealed that the downregulated genes were primarily associated with innate immune response. Upregulated genes are often found during the ion transmembrane transport. The top 40 differentially expressed genes were identified. The results showed that The levels of genes related to innate immunity (including Slfn4, Ly6e, Ifi2712, etc.) were significantly lower in the HLS group than in the CON group (Figure 3B). We performed RT-PCR analysis to validate the sequencing results and evaluate the therapeutic effects of GTSs. As shown in Figure 3C, HLS significantly decreased the expression of Isg15, Slfn4, Ly6e and Ifi27l2b, whereas the reduction in HLS rats were gradually reverted to normal levels after GTSs treatment.\n\nStructure Modulation of GTSs on Gut Microbial Under Simulated Weightlessness\n\nWe differentiated the data of each sample according to the barcode sequence, and the extracted data were saved in FASTQ format. The quality control data with reliable base calling are listed in Table S4. The rarefaction curve indicated that the amount of sequencing data obtained in this study was reasonable (Figure S2). Alpha diversity, based on Shannon’s analysis, was used to characterize the species diversity of the microbial communities. Strikingly, a sequential decrease in microbiota composition was observed in the HLS and GTSs groups (Figure 4A). However, there were differences in the relative abundance of dominant flora among the experimental groups, especially at the phylum and genus levels. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes dominated the fecal samples of all groups, and GTSs may have restored the relative abundance of these two species in rats subjected to weightlessness. Similarly, GTSs had modulatory effects on the dominant genera in the three groups, including Lactobacillus, Tumorcoccus, Oscillospira and All0baculum (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the Anosim test showed significant intergroup differences in bacterial community structure, and NMDS analysis was used to assess this change (Figure 4C). To further identify the most significant differential microbiota between the experimental groups, corresponding LEfSe analysis was performed (Figure 4D). The results showed that Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Jeotgalicoccus were the dominant bacteria in the model group, and their relative abundance was significantly reduced after GTSs intervention (Table S5). In addition, compared with the CON group, Lactobacillus, Lactobacillaceae and Bacilli were identified as the major contributing flora in the GTSs group. These results suggest that GTSs have a dual modulatory effect on the gut microbial composition and abundance in simulated weightless rats. KEGG function prediction revealed that GTSs may be involved in signaling molecules and interactions, energy metabolism, immune function, and the nervous system by affecting the intestinal flora (Figure 4E).\n\nGTSs Improves Short-Chain Fatty Acid Content in Simulated Weightless Rats\n\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and microbial metabolites have been proven to have beneficial effects on the intestinal barrier and inflammation. A reliable UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was established to measure the contents of four major SCFAs (acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid), which cumulatively accounted for 95% of the total SCFAs. The related figure and supporting data are presented in Figure S3 and Table S6, respectively. In addition to acetic acid, the contents of the other three SCFAs were significantly reduced in the HLS group, and GTS demonstrated the potential to restore SCFAs towards normal levels (Figure 5A–E). Correlation analysis was used to determine the contribution of the gut microbiota and SCFAS to the treatment of GTSs. In previous analyses, we found that GTSs not only dramatically regulated the relative abundance of the dominant flora in the HLS group but also had a unique regulatory flora. Figure 5F shows a strong negative correlation between butyric acid and gut microbiota, and the correlation coefficients of Prevotella and Jeotgalicoccus were more significant.",
