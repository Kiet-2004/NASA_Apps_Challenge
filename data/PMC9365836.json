  "title": "Characterization of gene expression profiles in the mouse brain after 35 days of spaceflight mission",
  "abstract": "It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nThe spaceflight environment is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during the course of mission activities. The susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to spaceflight-induced changes can be particularly devastating to the health, mission performance, and quality of life of the spaceflight crew both acutely and chronically. The health risk from spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects are a chief concern, examples are intracranial fluid redistribution results in alteration of brain perfusion, neurovestibular problems, and cognitive alterations in astronauts caused by microgravity and/or strong gravitational changes during ascent and re-entry. Long-duration spaceflights reportedly induce immune dysregulation, which is considered a risk to astronaut safety and mission success. Studies to date have demonstrated the altered distribution of peripheral leukocytes, a diminished function of specific leukocyte subpopulations, and skewed cytokine profiles in many astronauts. Many biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation following space radiation and space stressors in rodents and humans have been identified. However, the precise nature of immune dysregulation during spaceflight is not well understood. Evidence suggests that acute exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) induce detrimental CNS changes including an increased level of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive deficits similar to accelerated aging. Ionizing radiation has been shown to elicit neuroinflammation through direct activation of microglia cells and through the increased infiltration of immune and inflammatory cells through the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB). Study also showed that both microgravity encountered by astronauts in space and simulated microgravity on earth induce changes in brain structure and function. Microgravity induces a tremendous shift in body fluids, an increase in brain fluid and alterations in tissue perfusion. Space microgravity modulates the expression of cellular molecules, and alters pro-inflammation cytokine secretion. Neuroinflammation is also a central pathological feature of several acute and chronic brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to its high oxygen consumption, the content of oxidizable unsaturated lipids and low levels of anti-oxidant defenses. Oxidative injury has been implicated as a causative or contributory factor in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including aging, and ischemic, traumatic damage. Our preliminary studies have shown that spaceflight and ionizing radiation cause prolonged oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction that may lead to chronic inflammation and adverse remodeling. However, our knowledge about the mechanism and consequences of spaceflight condition-induced neuroinflammation is very limited. Because of the complexity of the processes and pathways that lead to neuroinflammation, an in-depth “omics” approach will potentially provide insight to understanding the impact of environmental insults on the CNS and the immune function that may have a long-lasting impact.\n\nThe goal of this study was to characterize changes in gene expression using a neuroinflammatory assay panel to investigate inflammation, neuronal function, growth, metabolism, and stress in mouse brain tissue after spaceflight.",
  "methods": "Materials and methods\n\nFlight and ground control conditions\n\nTen-weeks-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Inc. Bar Harbor, ME) at the time of launch, were flown for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission and lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats aboard the International Space Station. All FLT mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. Habitat GC mice were kept under similar housing conditions, including temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels using 48-h delayed telemetry data from the FLT group. Water and food bar diet specifically designed by NASA were provided ad libitum to FLT and GC groups. All mice received the same access to food and water. NASA-Ames Research Center and KSC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees approved this flight study. The study has been done in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health.\n\nMouse brain dissection after spaceflight\n\nWithin 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, the FLT mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2. The GC mice were euthanized with the same method after 38 days of GC housing. Shortly after euthanasia, brains were removed and bisected along the midline and coronally within the half hemispheres. The right caudal half hemisphere of the brain (containing mid- and hindbrain) from each mouse (n = 5–6 per group) was placed in a sterile cryovial, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C prior to use.\n\nRNA isolation and gene expression profiling\n\nIsolation of total RNA from the brain tissues was performed using DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, # 80224) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, tissue homogenization was performed using 1.5 mm beads (Benchmark, # 1032-15) on Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) in RLT Plus buffer. The purity and concentration of the eluted RNA were measured using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. RNA samples (20 ng/ul) were then shipped to Nanostring (Technologies Seattle, WA) and gene expression profiling of brain tissues was conducted using the nCounter® neuroflammation pathways panel. The panel includes 757 genes covering the core pathways and processes that define neuroimmune interactions and 13 potential housekeeping genes for normalization. RNA samples (100 ng each) on 2 cartridges were used for the Gene Expression Assay with Mouse Neuroinflammation panel performed on the nCounter MAX system (https://nanostring.com/wp-content/uploads/MAN-C0035_nCounter_Analysis_System_MAX_FLEX.pdf), a multi-channel epifluorescence scanner with Nanostring Advanced Analysis Module plugin for QC, normalization, and differential expression analysis (DE). Data files generated from nCounter system were analyzed using nSolver 4.0 software with the Advanced Analysis module for QC (quality control), normalization, DE analysis, and gene-set enrichment analysis. Data normalization included 2 steps: Positive control normalization to correct platform-associated variation and Codeset content normalization using the housekeeping (HK) genes to correct variability of input samples. Geometric means of selected HK probes were used to normalize counts of the samples and DEGs were generated from the normalized counts.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nGene expression profiling data were analyzed using nSolver analysis and the advanced analysis module software. Advanced analysis module software uses open-source R program for pathway scoring and gene-set enrichment analysis. Using the Reactome pathway database annotations, pathway scores are derived by calculating the first principle component of pathway genes’ normalized expression and data are summarized from changes of a gene set within a given pathway into a single score. To further analyze the associated pathways of the DEGs, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis was performed using biological process database to identify the annotated sets of genes based on the biological processes in which they participate. Significantly differential expression genes were presented in the tables with individual genes using log10 (p value) andlog2 fold change compared to the GC group. Pathview module was used to display upregulated genes or downregulated genes overlaid on KEGG pathways. For DEG and pathway analysis, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant between FLT and GC groups by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.",
  "results": "Results\n\nChanges of gene expression in neuroinflammation panel\n\nA set of 54 differently expressed genes (DEG) significantly (p < 0.05) by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test segregates the ground control (GC) group from the flight (FLT) group (Table 1). Clusters of genes related to neuronal function, neuronal cell support, immune function, and cellular growth and stress were significantly altered and organized based on their protein’s role. SIN3A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350), SLC2A5 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_019741), MERTK (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008587), TREM2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_025864), RIPK1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009068) are listed in multiple tables as they are found to play various roles.\n\nChanges of gene expression associated with neuronal function\n\nGenes directly involved with neuronal function were universally downregulated and are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 1. Overall, a picture of decreased neuron plasticity and signaling dysfunction is painted. Those genes that are involved in neuron support cell function were also found to be broadly downregulated and are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 2. Microglial cell and oligodendrocyte dysfunction were most pronounced along with the inhibition of myelin sheath maintenance. Levels of immune and inflammation related gene expression were grossly downregulated except for two upregulated genes, H2-T23 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398) and SOX4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238). The summary is presented in Table 4 and Fig. 3. Generally, we see the impairment of genes related to microbial defense with generalized dysfunction of immunity and disinhibition of inappropriate inflammation. And finally, genes with roles in cellular stress and growth are shown in Fig. 4 with downregulation in all genes with exception of HSPB1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_013560), GADD45G (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817), CCNG2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635), SESN1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001013370), and CDC25A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007658) which were significantly upregulated. In general, we see an increased cellular stress response, growth arrest, and a possible trend toward more inflammatory-associated cell death.\n\nSpaceflight-induced changes of pathways\n\nMany pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were altered by flight condition using DEG identified by Nanostring’s Advanced Analysis module pathway scoring through correlation-guided gene subsetting, which functionally annotated groups of genes followed by unsupervised clustering of samples. Higher scores compared to normalized gene expression general means upregulation while lower scores represent downregulation. Figure 5 summarized pathway results in a plot of all pathway scores compared to GC controls. Among these pathways, scores for angiogenesis, cytokine signaling, epigenetic regulation, and notch signaling were significantly increased which may indicate upregulation of the pathway (p < 0.05), while scores for innate immune response and oligodendrocyte function were greatly reduced in the flight group compared to the controls which may indicate downregulation of the pathways (p < 0.05) by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test (Fig. 6a–f). The score for microglia function was also decreased but with trending significance (p = 0.07) (Fig. 6g).",
