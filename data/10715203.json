  "title": "Genomic analysis reveals the presence of emerging pathogenic Klebsiella lineages aboard the International Space Station",
  "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nKlebsiella species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, are opportunistic pathogens that commonly cause infections in humans. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is a subgroup of K. pneumoniae, which has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals, and its escalating antibiotic resistance levels. Our study presents the first comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of K. pneumoniae, K. aerogenes, and K. quasipneumoniae offered insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates were part of emerging pathogenic lineages with K. quasipneumoniae ST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae, belonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. A potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS might pose a risk to the immunocompromised crew members. Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some Klebsiella genomes exhibited genetic divergence from their respective lineages, which we hypothesize results from the unique spaceflight associated environmental pressures. These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health.\n\nIMPORTANCE\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, hermetically sealed environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, including microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionising/UV). While bacteria's adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage. Moreover, we characterized plasmids from Klebsiella species of ISS origin, which harbored genes for disinfectant resistance and enhanced thermotolerance, suggestin possible adaptive advantages. Furthermore, we identified a mobile genetic element containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate of the “high-risk” ST101 clone. Our work provides insights into the adaptability and persistence of Klebsiella species during spaceflight, highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of potential pathogenic bacteria in such environments.",
  "introduction": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe genus Klebsiella includes eight species of facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria ubiquitously found in natural environments. They can also be found as human and animal gastrointestinal commensals. Some Klebsiella species are well-established human opportunistic pathogens known to cause both community and hospital-acquired infections (HAIs).\n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, is the most clinically significant Klebsiella species, exhibiting a multifaceted pathogenicity profile that encompasses urinary tract infections (UTIs), meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis. Its multidrug resistance (MDR), extended drug resistance (XDR), and association with hypervirulent (hvKp) lineages, which cause outbreaks in both community and healthcare environments, make it a notable concern. The dispersal of hvKp lineage strains is of increasing concern to the medical community. HvKp differs from classic K. pneumoniae (cKp) due to its ability to infect immunocompetent individuals in community settings. Infections associated with hvKp commonly affect multiple sites due to metastatic spread. Although there is not a clear definition for hvKp, there are several siderophore virulence factors (VFs) reported to be associated with a hvKp pathotype, mainly aerobactin (iuc), salmochelin (iro), and yersiniabactin (ybt). Recently, Kleborate, a genotyping tool has been developed to assess and quantify virulence among the K. pneumoniae species complex using a five-tier scoring system based on the presence of key virulence-associated loci.These virulence loci are commonly identified on mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as self-mobilizable plasmids and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Within K. pneumoniae populations, ICEKp is known to mobilize the ybt locus, which encodes for the key iron scavenging virulence factor yersiniabactin along with its receptor. Besides virulence factors, capsular serotypes K1 and K2 are more frequently encountered in hvKp. Other capsular types, such as KL106, are associated with globally disseminated pathogenic K. pneumoniae lineages, although their structures remain undetermined.\n\nOther Klebsiella species are also known to cause HAIs but rarely infect immunocompetent individuals outside of healthcare-associated settings. Klebsiella aerogenes is typically associated with HAIs in immunocompromised patients and infections primarily include pneumonia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and UTIs. K. aerogenes is known to produce a chromosomal cephasolosporinase (AmpC) exhibiting resistance to penicillins, first and second-generation cephalosporins, cephamycins as well as monobactams but at a hydrolysis rate <1% of that observed for benzylpenicillin. AmpC β-lactamases are not inhibited by β-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid, and as such, β-lactamase inhibitor combinations are not recommended for the treatment of K. aerogenes-associated infections.\n\nKlebsiella quasipneumoniae is further classified into two subspecies K. quasipneumoniae subsp. quasipneumoniae and K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae. Both subspecies have now been recognized as human opportunistic pathogens. Recent reports have implicated K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae as a causative agent of neonatal septicemia outbreaks in China and Nigeria, emphasizing the need for heightened surveillance.\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is an extreme hermetically sealed environment, which puts microorganisms under the unique selective pressures of microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionizing/UV). During the Microbial Tracking-1 experiment, which was dedicated to characterizing the ISS microbiome, 10 strains belonging to three different Klebsiella species were identified, namely K. pneumoniae, K. quasipneumoniae, and K. aerogenes. These Klebsiella isolates were retrieved from the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC), Cupola, the Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module, Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and Lab 3 of the ISS. Using culture-independent methods, it has been reported that K. pneumoniae can be identified in multiple locations on the ISS, with documented succession over time. K. pneumoniae exhibited noticeable persistence between different flights among propidium monoazide-treated surface samples. Additionally, metabolic modeling indicated that Klebsiella species play a key role in the ISS microbiome, benefiting co-existing microorganisms (e.g., Pantoea species). It was also found that K. pneumoniae displays parasitic interactions with Aspergillus species and amensalistic interactions with Penicillium species. The overall importance of understanding the genomic background, evolution, and persistence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms during spaceflight, in terms of medical astromicrobiology, has also been recently discussed.\n\nThe aim of this research communication is twofold: first, to generate complete genomes and circular chromosomal maps of the 10 Klebsiella strains isolated from the ISS, investigating their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, heavy metal resistance, and MGEs and would provide the first complete Klebsiella plasmids from the ISS. Secondly, to employ large-scale population genomics to understand the evolutionary paths and potential divergences of the ISS Klebsiella isolates from the Earth-based lineages.",
  "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nIsolation of the strains from the ISS\n\nVarious locations were sampled on the ISS using polyester wipes, and the metadata associated with the samples and their collections were published elsewhere. Briefly, each wipe was aseptically removed from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500 mL bottle containing 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and concentrated with a concentrating pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO, USA) using a 0.22 µm Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips (Cat #: CC08022). Suitable aliquots (100 µL) of each sample were plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar in duplicate and incubated at 25°C for 7 days, and well-matured colonies were picked, archived in semisolid R2A (agar media diluted 1:10), and stored at room temperature. A loopful of purified microbial culture was directly subjected to PCR. The targeted fragment was amplified (colony PCR) to amplify the 1.5 kb 16S rRNA gene to identify the bacterial strains. The following primers were used for the 16S rRNA gene amplification: the forward primer, 27F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′), and the reverse primer, 1492R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 50 s, annealing at 55°C for 50 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min 30 s and finalized by extension at 72°C for 10 min. The sequencing was performed using 27F and 1492R primers, and the sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro from DNAStar Lasergene Package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The bacterial sequences were searched against EzTaxon-e database and the initial identification was based on the closest percentage similarity (>97%) to previously identified microbial type strains.\n\nDNA extraction and sequencing\n\nCultures of the 10 Klebsiella strains were grown overnight on MacConkey agar plates at 37°C. DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with no pre-enrichment steps. The extracted DNA was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA) and the dsDNA High Sensitivity kit (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA). DNA purity was evaluated by measuring the absorbance ratio at 260 and 280 nm (A260/280) on a Jenway Genova Nano Micro-volume Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). For sequencing, DNA samples with a suitable quantity (>12.5 ng/µL) and purity (A260/280 of 1.80–2.00) were selected for downstream processing. Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing was performed on these samples at Oxford’s Genomics Centre (PE150). In addition, long-read sequencing for the DNA of all 10 isolates was carried out using an Oxford MinION Mk1C platform with a R9.4.1 flow cell (Oxford, UK).\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibilities for the 10 Klebsiella spp. isolates were determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method for a range of 8 β-lactam and 10 non-β-lactam antibiotics as previously described (Table S6). The diffusion test was performed on Mueller Hinton agar as a culture medium. Classification into susceptibility categories was determined using the clinical breakpoints provided for Enterobacterales defined by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (v.13.0, 2023). For nalidixic acid and kanamycin, breakpoints provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (30th edition) were applied. K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were utilized as quality controls.\n\nBioinformatic analysis\n\nFiltering and assembly\n\nFor short reads, quality filtering and adapter trimming were carried out using fastp (v0.23.2). Only reads with a Q score of over 20 were retained. For long reads, adapter trimming was conducted using Porechop (v0.2.4). Trimmed long reads were quality filtered using filtlong (v0.2.1) and only reads of 1 kbp or more were retained. Hybrid genome assembly was conducted using the hybrid assembly pipeline Unicycler (v0.5.0) with default settings. The quality of hybrid assemblies was assessed using QUAST (v5.2.0). Closed genome assemblies were visualized using Bandage (v0.8.1), separating chromosomal and plasmid sequences. Circular visualization of the chromosomes and plasmids coupled including COG classification of their genetic features was conducted using COGclassifier (v1.0.4) and MGCplotter (v1.0.1).\n\nGenomic characterization of resistance, virulence, and plasmids\n\nGenome comparison between the 10 ISS strains was also conducted using MGCplotter utilizing K. quasipneumoniae strain IF1SW-B2 as a reference genome (v1.0.1) (Fig. 1). The mobilization and conjugation potential of the plasmids were predicted using the Mobtyper tool from the MOB-suite software package (v3.1.0). Plasmid ST was determined using the plasmidMLST (v2.0) tool.\n\nANI analysis was carried out using ANIclustermap (v1.1.0). The bacterial chromosomes and plasmids identified were scanned for the presence of ARGs and VFs using Abricate (v.1.0.0) against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (card) and the virulence factor database (vfdb), respectively. Only results with coverage and identity >90% were considered. The presence of ICEs was assessed using VRprofile2. Species identification, sequence typing, K and O locus typing, and quantification of the respective virulence and resistance scores were conducted using Kleborate (v2.2.0) and Kaptive (v2.0.3).\n\nLarge scale comparative genomics\n\nTo compare the ISS Klebsiella genomes with Earthly analogs of the same ST, all available genomes from the STs identified for the ISS strains were retrieved from the Pathogenwatch database (Table S6). Their assemblies were annotated using PROKKA (v1.14.5). A pan-genome analysis for each ST, which included the corresponding ISS strains and the species typing strain, was conducted using roary (v3.11.2). Core genome alignment was determined using mafft (v7.47.1). Phylogenetic analysis was performed to infer the evolutionary relationships among the core gene sequences with RAxML (v.8.2.12) using the General Time Reversible-gamma model with rapid bootstrapping of 200 bootstrapping replicates. The presence-absence results from the pan-genome analysis and the phylogenetic tree generated were visualized using microreact. Data were also visualized using the R programming language.\n\nDedicated dashboards per ST have been generated and are accessible : K. quasipneumoniae ST 3234; K. quasipneumoniae ST138; K. pneumoniae  ST101 , K. aerogenes ST103.\n\nPhylogenetic trees displaying branch distances and bootstrap support values are presented in Fig. S2.\n\nHypervirulence multiplex PCR assay\n\nAn in-house developed and validated multiplex PCR assay, designed to detect hypervirulence in clinical K. pneumoniae isoalates, was used to verify the presence of yersiniabactin identified in strain F3-2P (2). The assay targets the ybtQ gene of the yersiniabactin gene cluster, the iucA gene of the aerobactin gene cluster, and the 16SrRNA gene as a positive control (Table S7). The multiplex PCR was conducted on a SensQuest Thermocycler with the following conditions: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C (15 s at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C) × 35.",
  "results": "RESULTS\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing\n\nAs expected, the Klebsiella isolates (n=10) exhibited resistance to ampicillin and rifampicin. Among the strains, three displayed resistance to a second-generation cephamycin (cefoxitin), five exhibited intermediate susceptibility to nalidixic acid, two to aminoglycosides (kanamycin), and one to sulphonamides (Table S1).\n\nAssembly statistics\n\nUsing hybrid assembly methods with data from both Illumina and ONT sequencing platforms, circular plasmid and closed chromosomal genomes were possible for all isolates. The assembly statistics are provided in Table S2. A direct genomic comparison of the chromosomes of all 10 ISS Klebsiella strains is shown in Fig. 1A.\n\nGenome typing\n\nGenotyping-based sequence type (ST) characterization identified four different STs among the strains. The most common ST among the K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae was ST138 (7/8 K. quasipneumoniae strains). These strains uniformly exhibited K48 and O5 locus alleles. Strain IIIF3SW-P1 was identified as ST3234 displaying K16 and O3 surface antigens. The K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P (2) belongs to the ST101 lineage with KL106 and O1/O2v2, while K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 to the ST103 lineage presenting KL119 and O3/O3a (Table S3).\n\nPlasmid characterization\n\nK. pneumoniae strain F3-2P (2) was found to possess a 216.722 Kb, IncFIIK (FIIK-9 allele) conjugative plasmid encoding for 234 coding sequences (CDSs; Fig. 1B). Key functionalities of this plasmid mainly include gene clusters associated with heavy-metal resistance and thermoresistance. Genes responsible for mercuric resistance (merA), arsenical resistance (arsA/B/C), copper resistance (copA/B/D/R), copper and silver export system (cusA/B/C/F/R/S), and genes that enable cell growth at high temperatures (cplC, htpX) were present.\n\nK. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 was identified to carry two previously unidentified plasmids: pIIF7SW-P1_1 is a 28.614 Kb, low copy (0.68 copies per cell), mobilizable plasmid identified to contain 38 CDSs (Fig. 1C). pIIF7SW-P1_2 is a 5.796 Kb, high copy (16.10 copies per cell), non-mobilizable plasmid containing six CDSs (Fig. 1D; Table S4). pIIF7SW-P1_2 was found to encode for the heat shock gene htrC.\n\nAverage nucleotide identity analysis of ISS isolates\n\nAverage nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis revealed that all K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae strains belonging to ST138 shared an ANI of >99.99% (99.998% ± 0.001%), indicating that they belong to the same clone that shows spatio-temporal persistence. Strain IIIF3SW-P1 (ST3234) shared an ANI of 99.148% ± 0.001% with the rest of K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae strains. K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P (2) and K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 were more genomically distant with respective ANIs of 93.237% ± 2.346% and 86.079% ± 0.041% when compared to the K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae strains (Fig. S1).\n\nComparative genomics of K. pneumoniae ST101\n\nThe K. pneumoniae ST101 is a globally distributed clone with over 696 isolates reported in over 33 countries on the Pathogenwatch genomic surveillance database. K. pneumoniae ST101 is widely associated with hypervirulent pathotypes. Overall, the ST101 lineage genomes exhibited high genetic similarity (ANI > 99.4%; Fig. 2A) and are predominantly associated with Europe and South-East Asia (Fig. 2B). F3-2P (2), the strain from the ISS, is most closely related to ERR985162, a genome retrieved from sewage wastewater in the UK in 2014, with an ANI of 99.86%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that F3-2P (2) belongs to a distinct sub-clade within the ST101 lineage, along with 41 other genomes (Fig. 2C). Out of the 696 K. pneumoniae ST101 isolates reported worldwide, 87.07% (606/696) were found to carry the ybt gene cluster, which is a determinant of virulence associated with the presence of yersiniabactin, suggesting that yersiniabactin plays a key role in the pathogenicity of this clone. Among these isolates, only nine encoded for additional siderophore virulence factors such as colibactin or aerobactin. Moreover, 98.2% (595/606) of the ybt-positive genomes encoded for ybt9, as part of a horizontally acquired ICEKp3. The integrative conjugative element ICEKp5, which was identified in the ISS isolate F3-2P (2) and carries the ybt14 locus, is a rarity, identified in only four other ST101 genomes.\n\nComparative genomics of K. aerogenes ST103\n\nThe genomes of the K. aerogenes ST103 isolates (n = 7), including the ISS strain IIIF7SW-P1, were found to be highly related with an ANI > 99.8% (Fig. 3A). The associated ST103 isolates were geographically confined, with isolates obtained from human hosts in the USA (n = 4) and Japan (n = 1) (Fig. 3B). The genetically most akin to strain IIIF7SW-P1 was SRR5666484, which was isolated from a human with a urinary tract infection in the USA in 2015 (ANI = 99.97%). Based on core-genome phylogeny, IIIF7SW-P1 formed a distinct node within the ST103 clone along with uropathogenic strain SRR5666484.\n\nComparative genomics of K. quasipneumoniae ST3234\n\nK. quasipneumoniae ST3234 is a seldom encountered clone with only two genomes listed in the Pathogenwatch database. The genomes of K. quasipneumoniae IIIF3SW-P1 and those of two strains from Oxford, England were found to be highly similar, with an ANI > 99.8% (Fig. 4A). The two UK strains were isolated from cases of invasive bloodstream infections (Fig. 4B). When analyzed using core-genome phylogenetics, IIIF3SW-P1 was part of a separate node from the two strains from Oxford (Fig. 4C).\n\nComparative genomics of K. quasipneumoniae ST138\n\nThe K. quasipneumoniae ST138 lineage exhibits a broader spatial distribution and higher genetic diversity compared to ST3234, with ANI > 99.3% (Fig. 5A and B). The genome most closely related to the seven ISS K. quasipneumoniae ST138 isolates was that of ERR4635453, isolated from a human in Tacloban city, Philippines in 2017, with ANI = 99.77%. The ISS strains (n = 7) formed a distinct clade within the ST138 lineage based on core genome phylogeny, indicating potential evolutionary divergence from the main ST138 lineage.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance genes\n\nThe ISS strains (n = 10) were found to each carry an average of 22.70 ± 0.64 antimicrobial-resistance genes (ARGs) (Fig. 6A). Among the genomes, K. pneumoniae F3-2P(2) (ST101) was identified to carry the β-lactamase gene blaSHV-1, which is known to confer resistance to certain penicillin and first-generation cephalosporin antibiotics (Fig. 6B). In the K. quasipneumoniae genomes of ST138, the chromosomal blaOKP-B-8 was identified. The genome of K. quasipneumoniae strain IIIF3SW-P1 (ST3234) was found to carry a blaOKP-B-3 allelic variant. The OKP-B chromosomal β-lactamase group is known to confer resistance mainly to aminopenicillins and carboxypenicillins and remains susceptible to the presence of inhibitors such as clavulanic acid. K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 (ST103) had three missense mutations in the outer membrane protein encoding ompK gene, which are linked with increased resistance to cephalosporins and cephamycins explain the observed phenotypic resistance to cefoxitin (Table S5).\n\nGenetic determinants of virulence\n\nThe ISS strains (n = 10) encoded for an average of 54.20 ± 8.95 VF genes each (Fig. 6C). The genome of K. pneumoniae F3-2P (2) encoded for 75 VFs, amonst which were the virulence loci for enterobactin and yersiniabactin. The yersiniabactin pathogenicity island (ybt-14 lineage) was part of a self-mobilizable ICE (ICEKp5) of 63.441 Kb. The ybtQ gene amplicon (234 bp) was also detected using a multiplex PCR assay for the F3-2P (2) strain. Moreover, the iron regulatory protein-encoding genes irp1 and irp2 were identified as part of the same ICEKp5. Consequently, strain F3-2P (2) received a virulence score of 1/5 based on Kleborate’s scoring system. The wb gene cluster relating to O1 antigen production, commonly found in clinical isolates, was also identified in strain F3-2P (2).\n\nFurthermore, all 10 ISS Klebsiella genomes encoded for the virulence-associated enterotoxin (entA/B/C/E/F). K. quasipneumoniae strain IIIF3SW-P1 (ST3234) encoded for the enterotoxin entD and wcaG/H/I/J, a gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of the outer core lipopolysaccharide. K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 was the only strain identified to contain the flgH/G/M/N genes, which encode for regions of the bacterial flagellar switch protein (Fig. 6D).",
