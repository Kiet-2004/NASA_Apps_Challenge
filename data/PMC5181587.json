  "abstract": "Highlight\n\nThe highly restricted movement of amyloplasts in graviperceptive cells of zig-1 hypocotyls is overcome by wortmannin treatment, suggesting a physical association between amyloplasts and the vacuole.\n\nGravitropism in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the sedimentation of amyloplasts in the endodermis, and a complex interplay between the vacuole and F-actin. Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 (zig-1), a mutant allele of VTI11, which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion. Using live-cell imaging with a vertical stage microscope, we determined that young endodermal cells below the apical hook that are smaller than 70 μm in length are the graviperceptive cells in dark-grown hypocotyls. This result was confirmed by local wortmannin application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls, which enhanced shoot gravitropism in zig-1 mutants. Live-cell imaging of zig-1 hypocotyl endodermal cells indicated that amyloplasts are trapped between juxtaposed vacuoles and their movement is severely restricted. Wortmannin-induced fusion of vacuoles in zig-1 seedlings increased the formation of transvacuolar strands, enhanced amyloplast sedimentation and partially suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 seedlings. Hypergravity conditions at 10 g were not sufficient to displace amyloplasts in zig-1, suggesting the existence of a physical tether between the vacuole and amyloplasts. Our results overall suggest that vacuole membrane remodeling may be involved in regulating the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts during graviperception.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nPlants have the capacity to sense and respond to the direction of gravity by precise modulation of growth patterns in roots and shoots. Gravitropism involves mechanisms of perception, signal transduction and auxin-directed differential growth. According to the starch-statolith hypothesis, sedimentation of amyloplasts in response to gravity stimuli is critical for gravity sensing. Gravity perception in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the ability to sense the position of starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, within shoot endodermal cells, or statocytes. This is supported by evidence that (i) mutants lacking an endodermis display agravitropic shoots, (ii) starchless mutants or mutants that lack amyloplasts show reduced gravitropism, (iii) hypergravity restored gravitropic sensitivity in starch-deficient mutants, and (iv) there is significant movement (sedimentation) of amyloplasts following gravistimulation. The sedimentation of amyloplasts in shoot statocytes is thought to trigger downstream signaling events, including changes in the transport of and response to auxin. The early events of signal transduction for gravitropism remain largely unknown, although several genes have been suggested to function in its early phases.\n\nThe current model of gravity sensing implicates the plant vacuole in the shoot gravity response. Shoot endodermal cells contain a large central vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume, and its role in gravity sensing is well established. Mutants with vacuolar defects, including mutant alleles of SHOOT GRAVITROPISM6 (SGR6), VTI11/ZIGZAG-1 (ZIG-1)/SGR4, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS22 (SYP22)/SGR3 and KATAMARI2 (KAM2) were identified from screens for agravitropic shoots in Arabidopsis. A common phenotype in these mutants was the abnormal localization of amyloplasts in relation to the vacuole or abnormal vacuole morphology. In the case of zig-1 mutants, the movement of amyloplasts in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem was greatly reduced. Both VTI11 and SYP22 are SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins that have important roles in membrane fusion at the vacuole, including homotypic vacuole fusion. Two mutant alleles of VTI11, zig-1 and impaired traffic to tonoplast3 (itt3), have multiple vacuoles per cell. Treatment of itt3 and zig-1 with wortmannin (Wm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), resulted in vacuole fusion, and enhanced hypocotyl gravitropism. This result is consistent with fragmented vacuoles being responsible for the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1. Two other proteins associated with endomembranes were implicated in gravitropism. KAT2 is a membrane-associated protein, and SGR6 is a HEAT-domain containing protein involved in vacuole membrane remodeling. The roles of KAT2 or SGR6 in gravitropism are still unknown.\n\nA tight association between amyloplasts and the large central vacuole has been described in inflorescence endodermal cells. In resting cells, amyloplasts are found at the bottom of the cell, where they undergo saltatory movements and are almost completely surrounded by the vacuole membrane. Amyloplast sedimentation that results from changes in the gravity vector occurs inside transvacuolar strands (TVSs), and the amyloplasts remain tightly associated with the vacuolar membrane during this time. TVSs may allow movement of organelles, and their formation requires actin filaments. It is unclear if the F-actin inside TVSs is required for amyloplast association with the vacuole, sedimentation, or mechanisms of gravity perception, but F-actin cables have been shown to associate with sedimenting amyloplasts inside TVSs. However, the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin-B in wild-type inflorescences. Overall, the mechanisms by which amyloplasts are so closely attached to vacuolar membranes, including TVSs, and the role of this interaction for gravitropism have not been elucidated. Interestingly, kat2 mutants, which are agravitropic in shoots, develop fewer transvacuolar strands in leaves and petioles, but it is not known if this is the case for shoot endodermal cells. Even though a clear role for the vacuole in gravity perception is well established, the molecular mechanisms for vacuolar control or perception of amyloplast sedimentation has not been identified.\n\nIn addition to the vacuole, important roles for actin filaments have been reported, but their role during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear. Actin depolymerizing drugs have been reported to enhance gravity response in hypocotyls, reduce amyloplast sedimentation in endodermal cells or have no effect in experiments with live cells. An important role of the actin cytoskeleton was demonstrated by the identification of the shoot gravitropism9 (sgr9) mutant, which shows reduced amyloplast sedimentation due to increased interactions between amyloplasts and F-actin. SGR9 encodes an E3 ligase that may disrupt the attachment of amyloplasts to F-actin during saltatory movements and as a result promote amyloplast sedimentation. The difficulty of establishing a role of F-actin in gravity perception may be due to the complexity of interactions that it may have with a multitude of cellular components, including amyloplasts.\n\nHere we used live-cell imaging on a vertical stage microscope to demonstrate the role of the large central vacuole in shoot gravitropism in seedlings. Our results identified the upper hypocotyl endodermis as the gravisensing tissue and highlight a novel tight interaction between the vacuolar membrane and amyloplasts. The fragmented vacuoles in endodermal cells of zig-1 hypocotyls restrict amyloplast movement, contributing to the agravitropic phenotype of this mutant. We show that application of Wm to zig-1 enhances their gravitropic response, restores amyloplast sedimentation and enhances the formation of TVSs. Additionally, we show that the tight association between vacuoles and amyloplasts observed in zig-1 hypocotyls involves neither F-actin nor microtubules.",
  "methods": "Materials and methods\n\nPlant material and growth conditions\n\nThe zig-1 mutant line was previously described. The parental and itt3 lines contain the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-TIP2;1 and the mCherry-HDEL markers, and marker lines expressing the fluorescent protein fusions VHA-a1:GFP, ABD2-GFP and TUA6-GFP were described before. Seeds were surface sterilized and incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 2–5 d. Seeds were sown on Arabidopsis growth medium (AGM; 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium, 4 g l–1 GelRite, 1% (w/v) sucrose) and transferred to a 22 °C growth chamber with 16 h/8 h day/night photoperiod. For dark grown experiments, plants were incubated in light for 8 h to stimulate germination prior to growth in the dark.\n\nPlasmid construction and plant transformations\n\nThe pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP construct was generated by amplifying a 2 kb fragment corresponding to the SCARECROW promoter (pSCR2.0) from pENTR 5′pSCR2.0 using primers 5′-AAGCTTTGCCAAA CAGATATTTGCATTTGGGCTATG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTAGG AGATTGAAGGGTTGTT-3′. The pSCR2.0 PCR fragment was cloned into VAC-GK by restriction enzyme and ligation with HindIII and XhoI to generate pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP. The resulting plasmid was then transformed into zig-1 or Col-0 WT by the floral dip method.\n\nChemical stocks and treatments\n\nAll chemical treatments used 4-d-old seedlings unless otherwise specified. Stock solutions of 3.3 mM wortmannin (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 μM latrunculin B (Lat-B; Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 mM oryzalin (Sigma-Aldrich) were made in 100% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted to working concentrations in liquid AGM as 1% (v/v) DMSO, 33 μM Wm, 2 μM Lat-B and 20 μM oryzalin. Vacuole fusion assays were carried out by incubating seedlings in either DMSO or Wm for 90 min to 2 h before rinsing in diH2O and imaging.\n\nLugol solution was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (62650). Staining was carried out by submerging Col-0 WT seedlings in solution for 20 min, while maintaining their growth orientation. Next, they were washed in diH2O for 10 min before they were mounted on microscope slides.\n\nMicroscopy\n\nImaging in a vertical stage was carried out with a Leica DM5000 compound microscope equipped with a Leica DFC365 FX camera, and a Leica ×40/1.0 NA water objective was used. The microscope was outfitted with a custom-made 90° InverterScope objective inverter (LSM Technologies) between the objective turret and the ×40 objective and a custom-made vertical stage (LSM Technologies) that included a manual rotation stage (Thor Labs). Bright-field imaging was accomplished by placing an aspheric condenser lens (cat. no. ACL1210-A, Thor Labs) inside the rotation stage ~10 mm behind the sample, and an adaptor was made by 3-D printing to attach the end of a light guide to the back of the vertical stage. The adaptor included a slit to slide a blocking sheet or a green filter (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). All imaging was done with the green filter inside the slit. Etiolated seedlings were affixed to slides using a very fine layer of Hollister Medical Adhesive. A 1.0 mm silicon isolator (cat. no. CWS-13R-1.0, Grace BioLabs) and a coverslip were used to create a chamber filled with water, and Immersol 518 F (Carl Zeiss) was used as the immersion oil for the water objective.\n\nA Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a ×40 water objective (1.1 NA) or ×20 objective (0.8 NA) was used for confocal microscopy. The excitation/emission wavelengths during acquisition were 488 nm/492–557 nm for GFP, and 516 nm/582–670 nm for mCherry. TVSs were counted as previously described. Briefly, hypocotyls were imaged in 600 μm thick optical sections using a ×20 (0.8 NA) objective to capture the volume of entire cells. Vacuolar membrane folds were counted as TVSs if they were formed by a double membrane, even if they did not transverse the entire vacuole in the XY plane.\n\nA centrifuge microscope was used for hypergravity experiments as previously described. Four-day-old etiolated seedlings were mounted in a chamber to fix the specimen on the centrifuge microscope before rotation; 10 g was applied after 10–20s of imaging and held continuously for 60s.\n\nQuantification of organelle movement\n\nTracking amyloplast movement was performed with the MTrackJ plugin of ImageJ. Amyloplast movement was quantified capturing time-lapse images for 3 min at 10 s intervals, but only amyloplasts that could be traced throughout all frames were scored. Seedlings were 4 d old for all experiments. The x, y coordinates of each amyloplast were recorded from each image. Then, the change in position in the x (Δx) and y (Δy) axes were determined and plotted in a coordinate graph. A stationary reference point such as the corner of a cell was used to correct for stage drift.\n\nTracking of amyloplasts during hypergravity experiments was carried out with G-Track spot-tracking software (G-Angstrom, Japan) as described.\n\nGravitropism assay and hypocotyl curvature\n\nCol-0 WT and zig-1 were sown on AGM, wrapped in foil to simulate dark, and oriented vertically for 3 d. All subsequent transfers took place in a dark room using a green safe light. Wm treatment was carried out by first aligning seedlings to the first gravity vector (g1) before placing an AGM dot containing either 1% (v/v) DMSO or 33 μM Wm on the top or bottom of the seedlings. For cytoskeleton inhibitor treatments, seedlings were transferred to fresh plates containing DMSO, 2 μM Lat-B or 20 μM oryzalin, and aligned to g1. Plates were wrapped in foil after transfers, rotated 90°, and scanned after another 20 h in the dark. ImageJ was used to measure hypocotyl curvature as the angle between the top of the hypocotyl and g1. All experiments were repeated at least three times.",
  "results": "Results\n\nStatocytes in etiolated hypocotyls are restricted to young cells below the apical hook\n\nAmyloplast sedimentation in shoots has been well characterized by live-cell microscopy in inflorescence stems but not in seedlings. In order to characterize mechanisms of gravity perception in seedlings, we first quantified amyloplast sedimentation in wild-type (WT) hypocotyl endodermal cells by Lugol staining (Fig. 1A). When cells from the upper portion of the hypocotyl were imaged, 97.8% of the amyloplasts were found sedimented in the direction of gravity. However, only 9.5% of amyloplasts were observed at the bottom of the cell when cells were imaged further down the hypocotyl. This result suggests that amyloplast sedimentation may be restricted to endodermal cells just below the apical hook.\n\nWe measured cell length along the upper hypocotyl endodermis to better understand the potential transition between statocytes and non-statocytes. Cell length was estimated from bright-field images of Lugol-stained WT, as well as confocal images of a GFP-tagged vacuolar marker exclusively expressed in the endodermis (pSCR::TIP-1;1-GFP, Fig. 1B). Cell length varied from 23 ± 3.69 to 94 ± 0.82 μm in this region when measured from the apical hook to ~1 mm towards the root, but on average, only cells with length <70 μm showed sedimented amyloplasts. Using amyloplast sedimentation as a marker for the ability to perceive gravity, the small cells at the top of the hypocotyl are more likely to correspond to the shoot statocytes. Given this result, all subsequent experiments described below were conducted with endodermal cells between 30 and 70 μm in length within this region of the hypocotyl.\n\nAmyloplasts in graviperceptive cells have been shown to be closely associated with the vacuole membrane, and mutants in the SNARE protein VTI11 have abnormal vacuole morphology and agravitropic phenotypes. The vacuole was visualized in WT and zig-1 using the pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP marker in order to determine the relationship between the vacuole and amyloplast in seedlings. As expected, a large central vacuole occupies most of the volume of WT endodermal cells and the tonoplast surrounds the sedimented amyloplasts (Fig. 1C). In contrast, zig-1 displays a fragmented vacuole phenotype in shoot endodermal cells, as previously described for other tissues. It is important to note that amyloplasts do not sediment in zig-1 mutants and appear to be trapped at the junction between two or more adjacent vacuoles (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, and similar to zig-1 inflorescences, the tonoplast does not tightly surround the amyloplasts in zig-1 hypocotyls. These results indicate that the vacuole phenotype of zig-1 impinges on the distribution of amyloplasts in hypocotyl endodermal cells and likely prevents their sedimentation.\n\nThe dynamic behavior of endodermal amyloplasts is restricted in zig-1\n\nA novel set-up for live-cell imaging on a vertical microscope was developed to identify mechanisms of vacuolar membrane dynamics involved in gravity perception or response (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Seedlings were grown vertically for 4 d before being mounted in a slide chamber and equilibrated for 5 min. Sequential images were acquired at 10 s intervals for 3 min in the vertical stage (Fig. 2A). Most WT amyloplasts were detected at the bottom of the cell between 0 and 3 min (Fig. 2B, 0–3 min), and organelle tracking indicates that they exhibited dynamic saltatory movements (Fig. 2B, 0–3 min). In contrast, zig-1 amyloplasts were found more widely distributed in the cell between 0 and 3 min, and they were severely limited in their movement as shown by their comparatively static tracks (Fig. 2C). Next, seedlings were rotated 90° and imaged immediately for the following 3 min (Fig. 2A). Amyloplasts from WT sedimented in the direction of gravity after reorientation as shown by the organelle tracks between 0 and 3 min after rotation (Fig. 2B, rotation). In contrast, amyloplasts from zig-1 continued to be much more limited in their movement even after a reorientation (Fig. 2C, rotation). These results, and those from inflorescences, support the role of the central vacuole in shoot gravity sensing.\n\nQuantification of amyloplast movement indicated that their movement in WT before rotation occurred in all directions for up to 10 μm (Fig. 2D, E). Following a 90° reorientation, most amyloplasts translocated to the new bottom of the cell (lower right quadrant of the graph) for up to 30 μm. On the other hand, amyloplast movement in zig-1 was confined to <5 μm in all directions before reorientation, and there was little change in their position after a 90° reorientation (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the fragmented vacuoles may impair movement of these organelles in zig-1.\n\nReduced amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1 hypocotyls could be due to the physical impediments created by the fragmented vacuoles. To address this question, we utilized hypergravity conditions to increase sedimentary movement and analysed amyloplast behavior using a centrifuge microscope. Two types of gravistimulation were used at 10 g, one applied longitudinally (along the shoot–root longitudinal axis) and a second applied perpendicularly, similar to a 90° reorientation assay. Upon application of hypergravity in either direction, amyloplasts in WT moved and reached the edge of the cell within 60 s (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, when 10 g was applied in either direction in zig-1, amyloplast movements were highly restricted (Fig. 3A), indicating a potential tight association between amyloplasts and the tonoplast itself. Measurements of amyloplast velocity indicated that these differences are significant (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results suggest that failure of amyloplasts to sediment in zig-1 is due to the abnormal vacuoles and a potential physical interaction between vacuoles and amyloplasts.\n\nWortmannin-induced vacuolar membrane fusion releases endodermal amyloplasts in zig-1\n\nWm was used to test the effect of vacuole fusion on amyloplast sedimentation. Wm inhibits PI3-kinase, reduces the amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate in cellular membranes, and induces vacuole fusion in zig-1. Seedlings were treated with 33 μM Wm in the vertical microscope stage (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online), and time lapses were collected within 3–8 min of Wm application and after 90 min. Figure 4A shows the orientation of the seedlings throughout the experiment. No obvious differences in amyloplast dynamics were observed in WT seedlings 3–8 min after Wm application (Fig. 4B, 3–8 min) when compared with the untreated control (Fig. 2B). Additionally, amyloplast movements still appeared severely limited in zig-1 when seedlings were imaged within 8 min of Wm treatment (Fig. 4C, 3–8 min). After 90 min of Wm treatment, WT amyloplasts were still sedimented in the direction of gravity, but the amplitude of saltatory movements seemed reduced (Fig. 4B, 90–93 min). In contrast, 90 min of Wm treatment in zig-1 resulted in many amyloplasts being found at the bottom of the cell (Fig. 4C, 90–93 min), compared with the untreated zig-1 (Fig. 2C). Seedlings were then rotated 90° and they were again imaged for 3 min immediately after. Upon reorientation, WT amyloplasts sedimented to the new gravity-associated cell bottom within 3 min (Fig. 4B, rotation). Finally, several amyloplasts in Wm-treated zig-1 sedimented in the direction of gravity following reorientation and their tracks were more similar to WT (Fig. 4C, rotation). Collectively, these results suggest that Wm treatment, which induces vacuole fusion, is sufficient to release amyloplasts in the endodermis of zig-1 hypocotyls.\n\nQuantification of amyloplast movements during these experiments indicated that amyloplast saltatory motion in WT was large (up to 20 μm) and showed no obvious bias in direction shortly after Wm treatment (Fig. 4D, 3–8 min). However, Wm treatment for 90 min restricted amyloplast movement in WT to within 10 μm of their initial position (Fig. 4D, 90–93 min). Again, most amyloplasts were able to translocate to the new gravity-associated bottom of the cell following the reorientation (Fig. 4D, rotation). In contrast, Wm treatment of zig-1 mutants had dramatic effects on amyloplast movement. Initially, zig-1 amyloplast movement was highly restricted to within 5 μm of their starting position immediately after Wm application (Fig. 4E, 3–8 min) in a similar fashion to untreated seedlings (Fig. 2C). However, after 90 min their range of motion had increased to within 10 μm, and sometimes up to 17 μm from their original position (Fig. 4E, 90–93 min). After rotation, several amyloplasts were able to relocate to the bottom of the cell and move up to 30 μm (Fig. 4E, rotation). These data confirm that altering vacuolar membrane morphology has profound effects on amyloplast movement in zig-1.\n\nWortmannin treatment of zig-1 statocytes partially restores gravitropism\n\nWe have shown above that statocytes in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl may be located just below the hook (Fig. 1). To confirm this, we took advantage of the effect of Wm on zig-1 vacuoles and amyloplast sedimentation (Fig. 4). Thus, we tested whether local Wm application to either the top or bottom of the hypocotyl was sufficient to restore gravity response in zig-1. A small dot of growth medium containing either 1% (v/v) DMSO (control) or 33 μM Wm was placed over the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl. The plates were then rotated 90° from the original gravity vector and the angle of hypocotyl curvature (α) was measured after 20 h (Fig. 5A). Col-0 WT responded to the new gravity vector when DMSO (control) was placed at the top of the hypocotyls, while zig-1 displayed an agravitropic response, as expected (Fig. 5B). When medium containing Wm was placed at the top of Col-0 hypocotyls, it induced a slight delay in graviresponse as indicated by an increase in the seedlings with an angle between 0 and 30° and a decrease in those between 30 and 60°. However, local application of Wm to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls resulted in an enhanced response to gravity. zig-1 mutants treated with DMSO showed a strong agravitropic phenotype, with most seedlings in the –30 to 0° and 0 to 30° categories, while zig-1 mutants treated with Wm at the top showed an increase in the hypocotyls between 30 and 60° and a decrease in those between –30 and 0° (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that Wm application to the upper hypocotyl partially suppresses the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 mutants. In contrast, application of Wm to the bottom of the hypocotyl did not have major effects on gravity response in zig-1 (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, only local Wm application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls can enhance their gravitropic response.\n\nLoss of VTI11 has dramatic consequences for endoplasmic reticulum organization\n\nThe dramatic restriction on amyloplast movement in zig-1 prompted us to determine if fragmented vacuoles altered the morphology of organelles of the endomembrane system, which could impede their flow. To this end, VHA-a1-GFP, a marker for the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and mCherry-HDEL, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), were analysed in the zig-1 background. Organelle morphology was analysed in hypocotyl cortical cells given the weak fluorescence of these markers in the endodermis. VHA-a1-GFP labeled typical TGN structures in WT and the zig-1 background (Fig. 6A–D). Not surprisingly, TGN puncta were found both in the cell cortex and in the cytosol that surrounded fragmented vacuoles of zig-1 (Fig. 6C, D). Therefore, loss of VTI11 does not appear to have an effect on TGN morphology. The mCherry-HDEL marker showed the canonical ER network organization at the cell cortex and ER bodies in WT (Fig. 6E, F). The ER was found surrounding the small vacuoles of zig-1, similar to the other organelles, but two distinct abnormalities could be detected. First, the cortical organization of the ER was altered as there was enrichment of ER membranes in the cortical domains that abutted juxtaposed vacuoles (Fig. 6G). In addition, aggregates of ER were found in the cytosolic domains between juxtaposed vacuoles and these appear to have restrictions in their movement (Fig. 6H and Supplementary Movies S1 and S2). These aggregates of ER could result from accumulation of fusiform bodies at these sites, in addition to aggregated ER membranes, but these are difficult to differentiate at the resolution of a light microscope. These defects indicate that vacuole morphology is important for proper ER organization. To further test this possibility, we determined whether Wm treatment of zig-1 would restore the cortical ER organization by promoting vacuole fusion. There were no apparent changes to the ER network in WT hypocotyls after treatment with Wm (Fig. 6I, J), although membrane aggregates were sometimes observed. As expected, Wm treatment induced the fusion of vacuoles in zig-1, and the enrichment of ER membranes was no longer observed in the cortex after a 2 h washout (Fig. 6K, L). These results overall indicate that vacuole morphology defects in zig-1 do not alter the morphology of the TGN, but it does have a dramatic effect on the organization of the ER.\n\nVacuoles and amyloplasts associate by cytoskeleton-independent mechanisms\n\nF-actin is involved in amyloplast saltatory movements in wild-type, and it may function as a negative regulator of sedimentation, but its specific role in the gravity response is unknown. Because amyloplasts appear trapped between fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 (Fig. 1) and are relatively static (Fig. 2), it was important to investigate if F-actin or microtubules were involved in restricting their movement. The cytoskeleton was visualized using the F-actin marker ABD2-GFP or microtubule (MT) marker TUA6-GFP in cortical and medial sections of epidermal cells (Fig. 7). F-actin cables were observed at the cortex in zig-1 (Fig. 7C) similar to the WT (Fig. 7A), except that the F-actin network surrounds the fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 (Fig. 7C). We conclude that the fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 do not impede F-actin polymerization or cortical arrangement. Similarly, microtubules were detected in the cell cortex in WT (Fig. 7E) and zig-1 (Fig. 7G). However, dense MT arrays were also observed close to juxtaposing vacuoles (Fig. 7H). Overall, the lack of a central vacuole in zig-1 does not appear to cause aggregates or abnormalities in the composition of the cytoskeletal network, except that both polymers are found surrounding the zig-1 vacuoles.\n\nWe conducted gravitropic assays in the presence and absence of the cytoskeleton inhibitors lantrunculin B (Lat-B) or oryzalin to determine if the cytoskeleton contributed to the static behavior of zig-1 amyloplasts. Lat-B induced an increase in the response to gravity in WT including an increase in the hypocotyls between 60 and 90° and hypocotyl curvatures of more than 90° in 22.1% of seedlings (Fig. 8A). No changes were observed in zig-1, with or without Lat-B, as most zig-1 hypocotyls were found in two categories, –30 to 0° and 0 to 30°, in both treatments (Fig. 8A). The ABD2-GFP marker was included in these experiments as a control to show the effectiveness of the Lat-B treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S3A). A possible role of MT in tethering of amyloplasts was also tested (Fig. 8B). There was a delay in the response of the oryzalin-treated seedlings, with an increase in the proportion of seedlings in the 0–30° category and a decrease in the 60–90° category. In the case of zig-1, both treatments resulted in very similar angle distributions, with almost all seedlings bending to an angle between –30 and 30°. Therefore, treatment with oryzalin does not enhance graviresponse of zig-1. Again, the TUA6-GFP marker was used to confirm the effectiveness of the oryzalin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3C).\n\nThat neither Lat-B nor oryzalin treatments suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 suggested that neither actin nor MT depolymerization was sufficient to release amyloplasts from the static inter-vacuolar junctions. To confirm this, amyloplast sedimentation was visualized after inhibitor treatment in the endodermis of dark-grown hypocotyls (see Supplementary Fig. S3B). In this experiment, seedlings were incubated overnight in the presence of DMSO, 2 μM Lat-B or 20 μM oryzalin to depolymerize the cytoskeleton. Seedlings were then incubated vertically for 10 min, imaged, incubated vertically again for 10 min but upside down (180° rotation), and then imaged again. Wild-type amyloplasts sedimented to the new bottom of the cell after the 180° rotation regardless of chemical pretreatment. In contrast, zig-1 amyloplasts did not sediment in either of the chemical treatments as shown by their static localization before and after reorientation (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Since depolymerization of F-actin or MT does not enhance gravity response in zig-1, nor does it restore amyloplast sedimentation, these results overall indicate that actin filaments or microtubules are not contributing to the immobile nature of amyloplasts by serving as a physical tether connecting amyloplasts and tonoplast. Therefore, the static nature of zig-1 amyloplasts is not explained by physical associations with the cytoskeleton.\n\nWm enhances graviresponse of vti11 alleles through dynamic TVS formation\n\nWe have demonstrated that immobile amyloplasts in zig-1 hypocotyls increase dynamic movements after Wm treatments. We then quantified transvacuolar strands (TVSs) in hypocotyls of WT and itt3 before and after Wm treatment (Fig. 9A) to test whether this enhanced motion is due to vacuolar membrane remodeling through changes in TVS formation. The parental line showed 3.07 ± 0.22 TVSs per cell in hypocotyl epidermis, while itt3 mutants had only 0.22 ± 0.04 TVSs when DMSO treatments were used (Fig. 9B). The number of TVSs increased to 4.17 ± 0.10 in the parental line and to 1.60 ± 0.05 for itt3 when seedlings were treated with Wm for 2 h. The significant increase in the number of TVSs after Wm treatment for both the parental line and itt3 suggests that Wm not only promotes vacuole fusion, but has a positive effect on vacuole membrane dynamics as well.",
