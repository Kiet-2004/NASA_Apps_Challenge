  "abstract": "Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts and poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space. Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study, JAXA CFE study, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.\n\nAn integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omics research from diverse spaceflight missions known as Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) is presented.",
  "introduction": "Main\n\nWith an exponential increase in launches since 2019, space is rapidly becoming more accessible. Multiple commercial and state-sponsored groups are developing roadmaps to construct space stations, moon bases, Mars colonies and other permanent establishments beyond Earth. Although innovation across the aerospace sector makes these ambitions technologically achievable, the biomedical challenges for crews in these extraplanetary habitats still need to be addressed, as humans did not evolve to survive in such extreme environments. The clinical consequences of this evolutionary mismatch of spaceflight exposure and adaptation have revealed a plethora of challenges to long-term space habitation, including a loss in bone density and muscle mass, spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, perturbed immune function and spaceflight anaemia. These physiological changes during spaceflight appear to imprint on the health status in humans; a chief example of this long-term effect is the increased risk of cardiovascular pathology observed in astronauts compared with age-matched controls.\n\nBefore long-term space habitation is feasible, these biomedical challenges must be understood and mitigated. However, the aetiologies driving them are not understood, with the low number of astronauts yielding limited opportunities for in-depth biomolecular characterization. For example, two of the largest multi-omic studies to date have been the NASA Twins Study, which has published an in-depth molecular and cognitive profile of a single astronaut, and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) project, which has profiled cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cfRNA in six astronauts. Thus, achieving statistical power requires integrating data from other cohorts, such as the MARROW study, and other missions. Furthermore, these analyses are complicated by the substantial variation in physiological responses to spaceflight among astronauts. Therefore, there is a need for increasingly large, detailed multi-omic profiles of astronauts to characterize the diversity of physiological shifts as a function of spaceflight.\n\nTo achieve this end, we have leveraged the burgeoning commercial spaceflight industry. With the launch of SpaceX’s 2021 Inspiration4 (I4) mission, a cohort of all-civilian astronauts successfully completed a high elevation (585 km), 3-day orbital mission within a SpaceX Dragon capsule. Using recently developed protocols, the crew participated in a range of biospecimen collections before, during and after their mission. We used the I4 biospecimens to deeply profile the effect of the stressors of spaceflight (for example, microgravity and space radiation) on crew physiology and health. We also compared these results with previous missions and control datasets, creating the largest-to-date molecular atlas of the effect of spaceflight on the human body, encompassing almost 3,000 samples and over 75 billion sequenced nucleic acids. Collectively, these resources are referred to as SOMA, and the samples are linked to a Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank (CAMbank) that stores viably frozen specimens for future, additional analyses.\n\nAs with Earth-based cohorts, these accessible data — when profiled and aggregated at scale — will enable the development of both personalized and general medical guidance for astronauts. A large group of subject matter experts in artificial intelligence has recently released recommendations focused on the importance of generating and archiving space data into the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) to enable autonomous and intelligent precision space health systems, and to monitor, aggregate and assess biomedical statuses for future deep space missions. In addition, the study of the parallels between the physiological effects of spaceflight and ageing, chronic disease and immune system disorders using omics data can pave the way for therapeutics applicable to conditions on Earth.\n\nHere we present a detailed guide to the SOMA resource, which includes the 2,911 samples collected during the I4 mission, as well as spatial transcriptomics data, long-read profiles of astronaut RNA, microbiome data, exosome profiles and in-depth immune diversity maps. Additional spaceflight data were annotated and compiled into the SOMA portal to help contextualize gene, protein or metabolite dynamics, including data from the NASA Twins Study, JAXA’s CFE mission, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data after simulated microgravity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and rat or mouse spaceflight data matched to human orthologues. In addition to rigorous dataset annotations, we detail (1) a comparison of conclusions on NASA Twins Study and flight dynamics comparing short-duration and long-duration missions, (2) cell-type-specific responses to spaceflight previously undocumented in astronauts, (3) cfRNA expression profiles showing haematological responses during recovery from spaceflight, and (4) additional analyses on individual responses to spaceflight from proteomic, transcriptomic and microbiome data. Data and samples generated in this study are available through SOMA (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu), NASA OSDR (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) and CAMbank (https://cambank.weill.cornell.edu/), which offer an unprecedented view of the multi-system omics changes before, during and after spaceflight.\n\nComprehensive astronaut data resource\n\nTo generate a comprehensive profile of the physiological changes of the I4 crew (29, 38, 42 and 51 years of age), 13 biospecimen sample types were collected and processed, including whole blood, serum, PBMCs, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) derived from plasma, dried blood spots, oral swabs, nasal swabs, skin biopsies, skin swabs, capsule (SpaceX Dragon) swabs, urine and stool specimens. After collection, samples were subject to a battery of multi-omic assays, including clinical (CLIA) whole-genome sequencing, a clonal haematopoiesis panel, direct RNA-seq (dRNA-seq), single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq), single-cell B cell repertoire (BCR) and T cell repertoire (TCR) V(D)J sequencing, untargeted plasma proteomics (liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry), untargeted plasma metabolomics, cfDNA sequencing, cfRNA, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and spatially resolved transcriptomics. In addition, chemokine, cytokine and cardiovascular biomarkers were quantified, and a CLIA lab (Quest Diagnostics) was used to perform a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel (Fig. 1a). Datasets were generated across ten timepoints: three pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), three in-flight (flight day 1 (FD1), FD2 and FD3), one immediately post-flight (R+1) and three recovery (R+45, R+82 and R+194) spanning 289 days (Fig. 1b). Assays were performed on all crew members unless otherwise noted (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).\n\nA total of 2,911 samples were banked, with 1,194 samples processed for sequencing, imaging and biochemical analysis (Supplementary Table 1). These results and assays subsume and expand on work and protocols from previous missions, including the JAXA CFE study, the NASA Twins Study and some NASA astronauts (Fig. 1c). This latter category spans studies primarily from the International Space Station (ISS) that lack certain metadata, primarily duration spent in space and launch dates, to maintain astronaut anonymity. These studies include chemokine/cytokine biomarker panels (n = 46 astronauts), comprehensive metabolic panels, telomere length quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ISS-surface metagenomic profiling (Fig. 1c).\n\nThe SOMA resources were first compared with the NASA OSDR database, which contains all publicly accessible human omics data from spaceflight and ground analogue studies. OSDR hosts 76 human omics studies, of which 11 are from human primary cells exposed to spaceflight. The other studies encompassed cell line and ground studies, including high-altitude studies (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2), which were all merged with the SOMA dataset. Once merged, the total number of sequenced nucleic acid molecules from this study represents a more than tenfold increase in the total amount of human omics data in the OSDR (Extended Data Fig. 1b), across all spaceflight studies, ground studies, cell line and primary cell experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).\n\nThe data from the missions were then divided into three analysis timeframes: (1) flight profiles, (2) recovery profiles and (3) longitudinal profiles (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Flight profiles reveal the most immediate effect of spaceflight, recovery profiles catalogue changes that occur after return to Earth, and the longitudinal profiles identify changes that have not returned to baseline after returning to Earth. We focused on several outputs for the resource, including first calculating differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for (1) PBMC snRNA-seq, (2) whole-blood dRNA-seq, (3) skin spatially resolved transcriptomics, and (4) cfRNA. We also mapped differentially methylated genes from whole-blood dRNA-seq, differentially accessible regions from PBMC snATAC-seq, isotype identification from TCR and BCR V(D)J sequencing, differentially abundant proteins from plasma and EVP proteomics, differential metabolites from liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry metabolomics, and microbial differentials from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assays (Extended Data Fig. 2), with all raw and processed data annotated in the OSDR (Supplementary Table 4).\n\nI4 reproduces NASA Twins Study\n\nTelomere elongation has been previously described in three astronauts who stayed for 6 months to 1 year aboard the ISS, but it was unclear how quickly such a phenotype appeared in astronauts. The average telomere length in all I4 crew members increased during spaceflight (17–22% longer), and this trend was statistically significant (mixed-effects linear model P = 0.0048; Fig. 2a). This finding is particularly notable, given the shorter mission duration (3 days total) and higher elevation of the I4 mission than the ISS studies, indicating that telomere length dynamics respond much more rapidly to spaceflight than previously observed.\n\nWe then compared the DEGs and cytokine changes from the Twins Study with those observed in the snRNA-seq data from the I4 mission, as well as compared with the expected DEGs of the assay from replicate negative control donor PBMCs (see Methods). The cross-mission DEG comparison highlighted a consistent response between both types of T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ markers (552 and 608 DEGs, respectively, both <2.2 × 10−16), across both sorted T cells or single-cell annotated cells (Fig. 2b). Conversely, B cells were less responsive to spaceflight, as expected from previous work in the Twins Study, which showed B cells as either not significant or less responsive to spaceflight. For the four overlapping cytokines measured in the Twins Study with our panel, we found significant increases in three: IL-6 (P = 0.014), IL-10 (P = 0.021) and CCL2 (P = 0.040) (Fig. 2c); these cytokines also showed changes and similar increases in other long-duration (more than 6 months) crews (Fig. 2c). However, we also ran a differential analysis of all cytokines detected on the I4 mission, to detect any differences from the Twins Study. Indeed, the levels of BDNF showed a statistically significant decrease (P = 0.00011, q = 0.0153), and IL-19 levels showed a statistically significant increase (P = 0.00015, q = 0.0153) during the post-flight (R+1) timepoint that returned to baseline during recovery (R+45 and R+82; Fig. 2d).\n\nDistinct RNA fingerprints of spaceflight\n\nBeyond recapitulating known biomarkers of spaceflight, the atlas integrated newer assays that were not available in previous missions, with a particular emphasis on RNA profiling. The first novel assay was spatially resolved transcriptomics on skin biopsies, which were obtained from all crew members during one pre-flight timepoint (L−44) and the day after landing back on Earth (R+1). The 4-mm biopsies were stained with markers for DNA, PanCK, FAP and α-SMA and then processed with the NanoString/Bruker GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, where regions of interest were selected based on the tissue structures identified by the fluorescence staining (Extended Data Fig. 3a). After filtering out outliers, the RNA counts were used for downstream data analysis, generating 95 regions of interest across four skin compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis and vasculature (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). This analysis revealed a distinct set of DEGs, including JAK–STAT signalling, and melanocyte signatures (Fig. 3).\n\nA second RNA assay for spaceflight integrated into SOMA was cfRNA profiling, which has recently been established as a dynamic tool for mapping temporal alterations in cfRNA composition and cell lysis. However, bulk cfRNA had not been utilized to measure the response of spaceflight until the JAXA CFE study and the I4 mission. Using principal component analysis, we identified a distinct separation in cfRNA profiles pre-flight versus post-flight and recovery for I4, suggesting a systemic physiological shift probably induced by space travel (Extended Data Fig. 3d). This was further reflected in the differential abundance of cfRNA genes across various timepoints, revealing specific patterns of noncoding expression (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and RNA types (Extended Data Fig. 3f) that correspond with the spaceflight timeline. The cell-type proportions inferred from the cfRNA profiles also exhibited spaceflight-associated variation over time and showed variation distinct from a set of healthy blood donor controls (n = 35; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). Cell types that showed significant post-flight shifts in proportion included hepatocytes, kidney endothelial cells, haematopoietic stem cells and melanocytes (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 5). Of note, the melanocyte cell proportions that demonstrated significant changes post-flight (Fig. 3c) were also found in the spatial skin transcriptomics data, providing additional evidence of adaptive skin responses to the space environment.\n\nA third novel RNA method applied to these spaceflight samples focused on RNA isoforms and RNA modifications (epitranscriptome), through dRNA-seq on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION and deep RNA-seq (more than 400 million reads per sample) on the Ultima Genomics UG100. These data quantified genes that were differentially expressed and displayed differential N6-methyladenosine methylation (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b), or both, and were analysed for enriched Gene Ontology pathways. We identified a set of sites (set M-I; Extended Data Fig. 4b) that undergoes hypomethylation during recovery, another set (set M-II) that is detectably hypermethylated from spaceflight, and a set (set M-III) that exhibits novel hypermethylation during recovery and longitudinally as well. The common pathways in all three sets (Extended Data Fig. 4b) showed evidence of radiation and telomere response, including ‘TSAI response to radiation therapy’ and ‘Wiemann telomere shortening’. In addition, the set of downregulated pathways after landing (recovery) was distinct, including genes associated with breathing regulation (for example, CO2 and O2 take-up and release by erythrocytes), which matches those pathways associated with crew response ranges (below, Fig. 5). Although further studies are needed to validate and delineate the potential mechanisms of these RNA dynamics (cfRNA, spatial and RNA modifications), these pathways suggest a potential relationship between RNA expression and methylation in regulating haematological and dermatological functions upon return to Earth.\n\nGene regulatory changes during recovery\n\nLeveraging the time-series data, we next analysed PBMC gene expression from snRNA-seq to discern whether unique DEGs are present at each timepoint. We examined DEGs from immediately post-flight (FP1) through the recovery profiles (RP1 and RP2) to observe how gene expression profiles are re-established after spaceflight. The number of DEGs was used to quantify the severity and recovery of crew response, and we also compared identified DEGs from a negative control group, including two healthy donors and read-depth- and cell-count-matched permutation group (Extended Data Fig. 5), with an average of more than 700 cells per crew member, per timepoint, per cell type. The DEG count (adjusted P < 0.05, |log2 fold change (FC)| > 0.5) decreased from FP1 to RP1 in CD16+ monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, ‘other’ T cells (but not CD4+ or CD8+), uncategorized (‘other’) cells and in pseudobulk (calculated from additive counts across cell types to represent PBMCs). However, the DEG count increased in B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 4a); by RP2, all cell types had lower DEG counts than at FP1 and began to approach the expected noise range of single-cell DEGs (Fig. 4a).\n\nAs DEG counts were higher at RP1 than at FP1 for several cell types, we hypothesized the introduction of distinct DEGs after landing back on Earth. First, we calculated the percentage of DEGs unique to FP1 at both RP1 and RP2, focusing on cell-type-specific DEGs (Fig. 4b). By LP2 (L−92, L−44 and L−3 versus R+82), we observed that nearly all differential gene expression was driven by the same set of genes that were differentially expressed at FP1, with the exception of CD14+ monocytes, which had a unique longitudinal profile not strongly connected with the DEG responses in other cells. With the exception of CD14+ monocytes, the RP1 profile is distinct in the abundance of DEGs not present in FP1, but this perturbation almost entirely (more than 95% of genes) disappeared after flight (RP2 and LP2). From the DEGs shared with FP1, we observed that gene expression directionality reversed for nearly all DEGs between FP1 and each recovery profile (Fig. 4c), indicating a return to baseline for those DEGs. The exception to this were two genes from the CD14+ monocyte population — AHR (log2FC of 0.742 (FP1) and log2FC of 0.808 (RP1)) and PELI1 (log2FC of 0.539 (FP1) and log2FC of 0.560 (RP1); Fig. 4c) — in which there was a positive log2FC expression at both FP1 and RP1.\n\nFrom the DEGs that were unique to FP1, we next quantified the uniformity of the pathway enrichment between two PBMC lineages: T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and monocytes (CD14+ and CD16+; Supplementary Table 6). Of note, 211 (70.8%) genes were unique to individual cell types and 87 (29.2%) were shared between two or more cell types (Extended Data Fig. 6a). To identify enriched pathways among the gene set for each cell type, overrepresentation analysis was performed on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways (Supplementary Table 6). Even though 70.8% of genes were unique to each cell type, their response was more convergent; unique pathways only ranged from 4.2% (CD4+ T cells) to 42.5% (CD14+ monocytes; Extended Data Fig. 6b). Yet some pathways were cell-type specific, such as the circadian entrainment pathway in CD14+ monocytes, with genes GNG2, GNAS, PRKCB, CREB1 and CAMK2D driving the overrepresentation from the gene set for this pathway (Fig. 4d). In addition, our data suggest that overrepresented pathways are sometimes more associated with cell lineage (for example, all T cells) than with the individual cell type (for example, CD4). This is evident from the longevity-regulating pathway that shares the PRKACB, NFKB1 and PIK3CA genes between both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations (Fig. 4d).\n\nIn addition, we found that certain pathways can be enriched across specific cell types belonging to different lineages. The inflammatory mediator regulation of the ‘TRP channel’ pathway, for example, was overrepresented in both CD8+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes, with each cell type contributing different gene sets associated with the pathway (Fig. 4d). Other pathways, such as the IL-17 signalling pathway, contain mixtures of shared genes and unique genes and are significantly overrepresented across all cell types (Fig. 4d). This also indicates that although cell types are distinct, they appear to have a set of core pathways in response to spaceflight, with 30–60% of overrepresented pathways shared both within and between lineages (Extended Data Fig. 6b).\n\nTo examine the chromatin accessibility and regulatory landscape in each cell population, we then analysed the transcription factor-binding site (TFBS) motif accessibility changes from snATAC-seq data to identify the top motifs in flight and recovery profiles (Extended Data Fig. 7). We first observed that increased gene expression was correlated with more accessibility at the transcription start sites, and closed chromatin was associated with downregulated genes (all P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, for all cell types; Extended Data Fig. 7a). The motif accessibility changes associated with recovery profiles recapitulated the trend in gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, which showed lower accessibility in regions of the genome with closed chromatin and higher expression in regions of more accessibility (Extended Data Fig. 7b). In addition, we showed the top five upregulated and downregulated TFBS motifs per cell type in FP1, RP1 and RP2, which revealed both common and distinct motifs and their accessibility across cell types (Extended Data Fig. 7c–e). These data also provided further evidence of cell-type specificity in the differences of chromatin and transcription factor accessibility dynamics.\n\nIntra-individual spaceflight responses\n\nTo understand individual variation during spaceflight, the coefficient of variation was measured across microbial, proteomic, cytokine and gene expression normalized count data, calculated by time interval (pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight and recovery). Normalized coefficient of variation scores (see Methods) were calculated for each body area from the microbial swabs from both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. The oral and forearm microbial variation (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b) showed Rothia mucilaginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis as leading variable strains, but each body site has distinct higher coefficient of variation species (other body sites are shown in Extended Data Fig. 8c–j and Supplementary Table 7). Similarly, abundance standardized coefficient of variation scores were calculated for EVP proteomic, plasma proteomic, metabolomic, RNA-seq, dRNA-seq, and cytokine abundance normalized protein and gene counts (Extended Data Fig. 9a–f). To characterize the participant-to-participant variation and null distributions, we also calculated the differentials for FP1 along with label permutation testing on these calculations to confirm that post-flight coefficient of variation was not higher than other timepoints (see Methods; Supplementary Table 8).\n\nWe then utilized the data across missions (I4, Twins Study and JAXA), assays (scRNA-seq, cfRNA, bulk RNA-seq and proteomics) and cell types (CD4, CD8, CD14 and CD16) to find the most recurrent pathways associated with spaceflight. The most enriched pathways were antigen binding, haemoglobin, cytokine signalling and immune activation, which confirmed the DEG-related signatures and also validated the signatures from our I4 mission (Fig. 5). Moreover, the NASA Twins Study data and cfRNA profiles from the JAXA study confirmed many of the top-ranked pathways, while also showing differences between bulk blood RNA and protein markers and purified cell populations. These data indicate that leveraging both bulk and sorted cell populations can help to clarify signals coming from crew blood dynamics related to spaceflight.\n\nAccess to datasets and crew samples\n\nThis study introduces full accessibility of astronaut data to the scientific community. Datasets are accessible through an online web portal and scientific data repositories, as well as controlled access to more sensitive data (for example, genetic sequence data) and physical specimens. The online web portal splits the data into three data browsers: the SOMA browser, the I4 single-cell browser and the microbiome browser (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). The SOMA browser (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/SOMA_Browser/) enables visualization of gene expression (bulk RNA-seq, snRNA-seq, cfRNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomics), mass spectrometry (plasma proteomics, plasma metabolomics and plasma EVP proteomics) and microbial (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic) data. Gene expression and protein abundance are visualized for each astronaut by timepoint, with fold-change values, statistical significance (q value) and summary tables. Any selected gene is also then plotted across data for other missions, including the JAXA CFE study, the NASA Twins Study, mouse spaceflight datasets from NASA OSDR and Genelab, and control cohorts. For additional granularity, the single-cell browser (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Multiome/) provides visualizations specific to single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data, and includes quality metrics, cell-type annotations, gene co-expression and chromatin accessibility magnitude estimates. Finally, the microbiome browser contains metagenomic and metatranscriptomic boxplots (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Microbiome/) from each timepoint of the study, spanning eight skin locations, deltoid swabs collected pre-skin biopsy, swabs of the SpaceX Dragon capsule and stool samples.\n\nThe remaining biospecimens from this study have been preserved and catalogued for continued use by the scientific community (https://cambank.weill.cornell.edu/). These samples include venous blood plasma, venous blood serum, viably frozen PBMCs, vacutainer red blood cell pellets, urine (both crude and with nucleic acid preservative), extracted saliva nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), extracted whole-blood total RNA, extracted skin swab nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and extracted stool nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). A subset of these samples will be available for additional assays and hypothesis testing by other groups, and the remainder are allocated for long-term biobanking. These data and specimen resources for astronauts can help enable larger cohorts for increased statistical power and also for new biomedical technologies that will emerge in the future.",
  "methods": "Methods\n\nInstitutional Review Board statement\n\nAll participants consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX, and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board at Weill Cornell Medicine, under protocol 21-05023569. All crew members consented to data and sample sharing.\n\nI4 data compendium data generation\n\nFull methodology for sample preparation, nucleic acid/protein extraction, sequencing, mass spectrometry and analysis are reported in Supplementary Note 1. Sample collection has been previously reported.\n\nI4 versus NASA Twins Study cytokine analysis\n\nDifferential abundance analyses of cytokines and other analytes were conducted using a mixed-effects model. This model included fixed effects for time, treated as a categorical variable with levels corresponding to preflight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), immediate return (R+1) and recovery periods (R+45, R+82 and R+194). In addition, participant-specific effects were incorporated as random effects in the model. The P values for the coefficients obtained from this model were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.\n\n10x Genomics snRNA-seq negative control data\n\nWe acquired cryovials of PBMCs from a healthy man 22 years of age (AllCells) and stored them in vapour-phase liquid nitrogen cryotanks. Two cryovials from this donor were thawed and processed on two different days in the same week, at the same laboratory, using the 10x Genomics demonstrated protocol called Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000365). From each day’s nuclei suspension, ATAC and gene expression libraries were generated (in technical triplicates on the same chip) according to the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User Guide (CG000338) and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencer. The resulting single-nucleus GEX and single-nucleus ATAC files were aligned using the cellranger-arc pipeline (v2.0.2) from 10x Genomics against the human reference genome hg38. Quality control and cell annotation were performed on the snGEX gene-cell matrices using the R Seurat package (v4.2.0). Subpopulations were clustered and labelled using a publicly available Azimuth human PBMC reference in conjunction with Seurat’s supervised clustering functionality. DEG analysis for labelled subpopulations was performed using the FindMarkers functionality of Seurat, with a log fold change (logFC) cut-off point of 0.5. P values of resultant genes were measured using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and deemed significant for P < 0.05. Correlation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes in FP1 was characterized by summing up the accessibility in a promoter window consisting of the transcription start site ± 500 bp for every cell in a given cell type across every gene, normalizing it to counts per million, taking the log2 difference between the different timepoints and matching it to the log2FC from the differential RNA analysis.\n\nRecovery profile analysis\n\nDEGs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data were filtered for |logFC| > 0.5 and adjusted P < 0.05 for the FP1, RP1, RP2 and LP2 profiles. An UpSet plot of shared genes was generated using Intervene. Overrepresented pathways were calculated using WebGestalt using the default parameters and the KEGG database. Pathways included in the analysis were within the top 40 lowest false discovery rate values or all pathways with a false discovery rate under 0.05.\n\nTranscription factor motif accessibility analysis\n\nchromVAR was used for the analysis of sparse chromatin accessibility from 10x Genomics single-cell data. The FindMarkers function of the Seurat package was used for differential analysis with setting mean.fxn as rowMeans and fc.name = “avg_diff”. The top five differentially accessible transcription factor motifs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data for the FP1, RP1 and RP2 were selected for visualization by heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated by the ComplexHeatmap R package.\n\nCalculation of individual variation\n\nTo distinguish the analytes that varied with the greatest magnitude between individual crew members (C001, C002, C003 and C004), a coefficient of variation (CV) calculation was applied across measurements collected for each: metagenomic species, metatranscriptomic species, plasma protein abundance, EVP protein abundance, metabolite abundance, cytokine abundances (Alamar Bio) and gene expression values (Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq). CV calculations were performed using the formula ‘np.std(x, ddof = 0)/np.mean(x)’, where ‘x’ is the array of normalized analyte values and ‘np’ refers to the numpy scientific computing package (v = 1.26). CV calculations were split into pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), post-flight (R+1) and recovery (R+45 and R+82) intervals. The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data also include the in-flight (FD2 and FD3) interval.\n\nBefore performing the CV calculation, data were first normalized. The ‘limma’ R package was applied to the plasma proteomic, EVP proteomic and metabolite data (v3.52). DESeq2 (v1.36.0) was applied to the Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq data. For microbiome data, to measure individual contributions per astronaut and for each tissue type (‘armpit’, ‘forearm’, ‘nasal’, ‘oral’, ‘post-auricular’, ‘T-zone’, among others), we averaged MetaPhlAn4, species-level, relative abundance values across our collected sample points. CVs were calculated for individual genes, proteins and microbial organisms.\n\nAn abundance standardized CV calculation was also performed to correct for the mean/CV relationship in the assays. First, the normalized abundance values across all the analytes of a given dataset were split into approximately 100 mean-abundance quantiles (M_q where q is 1–100 or fewer, in case it resulted in less than 10 points per quantile group). For each quantile group, the mean and the standard deviation of CV values for the analytes belonging to M_q were calculated (CVmean_q and CVs.d._q, respectively) to prepare the mean/CV distribution reference set across all timepoints and samples. Then, for a given timepoint, the CV calculated for each analyte was matched to the corresponding CVmean_q and CVs.d._q based on cross-referencing to the M_q interval overlap. Finally, the abundance standardized CV was calculated as the z score of the CV as (CV − CVmean_q)/(CVs.d._q). Permutation testing of the post-flight versus pre-flight difference was performed by repeating this procedure 10,000 times on shuffled labels for samples, taking the difference. Rank and z score of the observed value were calculated against the random permutations to order the genes and used as input to fGSEA for pathway enrichment analysis. Gene Ontology analysis on abundance standardized CVs was performed with Enrichr using the default settings.\n\nAdditional methods and details\n\nIn-depth methods and protocol information for all assays in Fig. 1a is located in Supplementary Note 1.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\nOnline content\n\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at 10.1038/s41586-024-07639-y.\n\nSupplementary information",
