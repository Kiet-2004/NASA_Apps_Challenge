  "abstract": "Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture. While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT. Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality (related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs < 50 mo at time of IR vs NHPs > 50mo (p = 0.03). Animals older than 50 mo at IR lost Ct.Th in T9 by 2 mo post IR (p = 0.0009), which persisted to 8 mo. In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 4 mo post-IR for T9, and 6 mo post IR for L2 and L4 (p < 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 mo at IR, both Ct.Th and BMD decreased in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 mo post-IR (p < 0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid loss of BMD and Ct.Th from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD in out of field vertebrae. Bone is sensitive to high dose radiation, and rapid loss of bone structure and density could facilitate fractures.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nRadiation therapy (RT) is a risk factor for bone morbidity and fracture. Vertebral RT significantly increases the risk of post-treatment vertebral compression fracture (VCF). Acute structural bone changes have been reported following pelvic, lumbar spine, and thoracic RT, however clinically relevant data on this topic is currently limited.\n\nBone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) are two of the primary metrics used to quantitatively describe bone structural changes and predict for fracture risk. The severity of RT-induced structural changes appears be impacted by both dose and age at irradiation. Wei et al. showed that doses as low as 5 Gy correlated with significant BMD loss (>20%) within just 4 months of irradiation (IR), and this effect was persistent at 9 month follow-up. While data regarding acute changes in BMD post-RT from clinical studies is limited, literature describing the acute changes in Ct.Th post-RT that could predispose to fracture are nearly absent. This is due to limitations in conventional computed tomography (CT) resolution of follow-up scans. Both decreased Ct.Th and BMD may predispose those at highest risk of VCF towards progression and collapse with symptoms. Early identification of those at highest risk for RT induced bone changes could potentially allow for better selection for prophylactic interventions. The effects of RT are difficult to study using clinical data alone due to numerous confounding factors. These factors include chemotherapy, steroids, reduced mobility, and direct bony infiltration by tumor, which are all detrimental to bone health.\n\nNon-human primates are a good model for studying bone related changes that can be translated to expected responses in humans. These NHPs exhibit both changes of normal aging and response to fractionated RT that is well correlated with what has been shown in humans. In the present study, we assessed the subacute, longitudinal effects of IR on vertebral structural properties (e.g., Ct.Th and BMD) in rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) when irradiated prior to or after skeletal maturity. Our goal was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae of NHPs post-irradiation (IR) that we could assess using our cortical thickness and dose mapping approach for measuring longitudinal architectural and density changes.",
  "methods": "Methods\n\nSubjects\n\nSixteen male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were exposed to uniform total chest irradiation using anterior-posterior parallel-opposed 6 MV x-ray beams. At time of IR the ages of the non-human primates (NHPs) ranged from 45 – 134 months old with a median of 57 months (young adults). Weights at time of IR ranged from 4.4–11.25 kg. These subjects were randomized into one of two treatment groups, either saline (n=7) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic “Hexyl”, a potential mitigator of radiation injury in lung (n=9, 0.125 mg/kg in a saline vehicle). Increased oxidative stress, with reduced cellular antioxidant defenses including SOD, is a putative mechanism for pathologic bone loss for many conditions, including estrogen deficiency at menopause. Thus this treatment is a potential mitigator for any radiation induced bone loss. Treatment was administered 24 hours following IR and continued twice daily for the duration of the study. The original primary focus of the study was not bone outcomes, but rather pneumonitis and the extent and/or prevention of pulmonary toxicity.\n\nAnesthesia Technique\n\nEach NHP to be irradiated was anesthetized with ketamine (5–15 mg/kg, intramuscular) and dexmedetomidine (0.0075–0.015 mg/kg, intramuscular) and then positioned supine with arms extended overhead. Atipamizole 0.0375–0.075 mg/kg IM was delivered for reversal of dexmedetomidine after irradiation.\n\nIrradiation Technique\n\nA clinical linear accelerator with 6MV photons was used to deliver 10Gy to the anterior-posterior midplane of the thorax of each animal, using a single 6MV x-ray anterior (AP) field and a single 6MV x-ray posterior (PA) field in parallel-opposed, isocentric geometry. Open, rectangular oblong fields (X-Y field size dimensions of 13.0cm (4.0cm, 9.0cm) × 12.0cm) were used without blocking of structures in the thorax with the field central axis placed at the xiphoid. Each field covered the superior aspect of the lungs and included the inferior lung to 4 cm below the xiphoid process. The lateral aspects of each lung and external skin surfaces were included within the radiation fields. The AP field included a 10 to 30 degree wedge (heel superior, angle determined from a computerized tomography (CT) scan of each animal) to compensate for the inferior-to-superior slope of the anterior chest wall, for improved dose homogeneity at midplane. Monitor units (dose delivery settings for the linear accelerator) were calculated assuming homogeneous tissue using measured animal AP diameters, grouping animals into three cohorts by their average AP dimensions.\n\nEach anesthetized animal was placed in the irradiation position and imaged via electronic portal imaging (EPID, iViewGT Amorphous Silicon EPID on a Elekta Infinity Linear Accelerator, 6 MV x-rays) for the AP and then PA fields. The PA field was irradiated first, followed by the AP field (+ wedge) with a nominal dose rate of 6 Gy/min, 5 Gy per field, 10 Gy total to midplane. Each portal imaging procedure, an average of 2 image pairs per IR field, delivered slightly less than 0.02Gy, for a negligible additional dose to the midplane of 0.08 Gy (10.08 Gy total to midplane). A representative dose distribution is shown in Figure 1. All research was approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nImaging and Vertebral Body Segmentation\n\nTotal body CT scans were performed for all NHPs at 2 month prior to IR and then at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months following IR. Each CT scan was examined to identify bony pathologies, fractures, and deformities. The thoracic and lumbar vertebrae were segmented from each CT scan using automated thresholding techniques and manual editing in Mimics (v16.0 Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). Intervertebral disks were excluded and only the bony anatomy was contoured. The vertebral bodies were isolated, and a 3D surface was constructed. The height and diameter of each vertebral body were obtained using measurement tools in Mimics. Each surface was registered to a canonical primate vertebral column using rigid and affine transforms in 3D slicer (v. 3.6, https://www.slicer.org).\n\nCortical Thickness Analysis\n\nCortical thickness within each vertebrae was measured using our Ct.Th radiation dose mapping approach. Ct.Th was determined at 2000 uniformly distributed vertices along the surface of each vertebral column using Stradwin (v. 5.1 Cambridge, England). The percent change in cortical thickness at homologous vertices was calculated for all scans.\n\nTrabecular Bone Mineral Density Analysis\n\nSimilarly, the mean CT density in Hounsfield units (HU) of homologous cylindrical trabecular bone volume in each vertebra was collected in Mimics from multiple slices in each vertebrae roughly 2 – 4 mm apart, excluding end growth plates, and the average HU for each vertebrae was obtained. All scans except six of the pre-irradiation (baseline) scans included a tissue density phantom consisting of materials of known tissue densities, used to convert Hounsfield units into BMD. All scans were performed on the same CT machine and with the same tissue density phantom. For those six baseline scans that did not include the phantom during image acquisition, an average of the data from the scans that included the phantom was used to calculate BMD.\n\nTo assess density changes in out-of-field structures, the sarcum and pelvis was segmented using automated thresholding techniques and manual editing in Mimics (v16.0 Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). The average BMD of the pelvis was calculated at baseline and the 4 month time point time and comparisons were made using paired t tests.\n\nPathologic analysis of bone samples\n\nVertebral samples from the thoracic and lumbar spine were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours prior to storage in 70% ethanol. In preparation for histology, vertebrae were decalcified with a 10% formic acid solution. Specimens were cut in sagittal cross section. Five micrometer representative sections of vertebral bone were cut with a microtome, placed on glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using R version 3.2.4 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). For NHPs that remained until study conclusion, BMD and cortical thickness were compared at all measured time points using repeated measures ANOVA, with Bonferroni post hoc analyses performed for pairwise comparisons. For any NHP removed prior to the conclusion of the study before the 4 month time point, comparisons were made using paired t tests. Toxicity that resulted in removal from the study was compared using a Kaplan Meier analysis.",
  "results": "Results\n\nEight NHPs were removed from the study between the 2 and 4 month time points due to pulmonary complications; NHPs younger than 50 months old at IR were more prone to a level of pulmonary toxicity that met criteria for a humane endpoint than those older than 50 months at irradiation (p = 0.03) as illustrated in Figure 2. Pulmonary effects will be described in a separate report.\n\nA linear regression was performed that compared the BMD and C.Th in NHPs that received hexyl vs saline to determine any radioprotective effects on bone changes; hexyl treatment did not affect the measured bone outcomes as measured by comparing slope of the regression (Figure. 3). Body weight increased from baseline during the follow up period (Figure 4). The mean bodyweight prior to IR was 6.9 kg, and 7.12 kg at time of first follow up. For those NHPs enrolled until the study period, the mean body weight at time of last follow up was 8.27 kg.\n\nFor NHPs that remained to the study conclusion, significant loss of Ct.Th in the in-field T9 occurred by 2 months post-IR (p = 0.0009), and this loss persisted to 8 months (Figure 5, Bottom Graphs). In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae located out-of-field, either L2 or L4. Reduced BMD in these animals was observed by 4 months post-IR for T9 and by 6 months post IR for L2, and L4 (p < 0.01; Figure 6). In those NHPs that were removed prior to the study conclusion, both Ct.Th and BMD were lower in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 months post-IR (p < 0.05; Figures 5 and 6; Bottom Graphs). At an even more distant site, the whole pelvis, BMD was not different at the endpoint for those that were removed from the study prior to conclusion (2 months; p>0.4) or in those that remained to study conclusion (8 months; p>0.08). Histologically, the regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased cortical porosity (Figure 7).",
