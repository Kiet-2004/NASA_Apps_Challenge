  "abstract": "Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the sequels of long-term space missions. Here we sought to determine how space microgravity (µG) impacts the metabolomics profile of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased glutamate and energy metabolism while the OLPs were in space for 26 days. We also show that after space flight, OLPs (SPC OLPs) display significantly increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. These data are in agreement with our previous work using simulated microgravity. In addition, our global metabolomics approach allowed for the discovery of endogenous metabolites secreted by OLPs while in space that are significantly modulated by microgravity. Our results provide, for the first time, relevant information about the energetic state of OLPs while in space and after space flight. The functional and molecular relevance of these specific pathways are promising targets for therapeutic intervention for humans in long-term space missions to the moon, Mars and beyond.",
  "introduction": "1. Introduction\n\nNumerous studies have shown that in normal mammalian cells grown in culture, microgravity induces an array of phenomena such as apoptosis and changes in their cytoskeleton, as well as in signal transduction, cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and adhesion. Effects differ depending on the cell type. Microgravity also alters differentiation and augments apoptosis in thyroid carcinoma cells and alters breast cancer-derived cells. Microgravity is thus considered as a platform to study the metabolism of normal, developing, mature and cancerous cells, as well as the potential pharmacological approaches to treat, on Earth, neurodegeneration, developmental disabilities and cancer.\n\nWe have pioneered the study of simulated microgravity (sim-μG) using the “the 3D-clinostat” robot (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) on neural cells and, in particular, neural stem cells and oligodendrocytes (OLs). OLs are the myelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are essential for the efficient synthesis and maintenance of myelin. They form the compact segments of the myelin membrane that coil around the axon and allow for the saltatory conduction of action potentials, ensuring the healthy functioning of the CNS. Neurological diseases involving this cell type are characterized by myelin loss and an impairment in nerve conduction. A lack of or damaged myelin is debilitating and disabling because the nerve impulses slow down or even stop, causing neurological deficits. Understanding how OL progenitors (OLPs) differentiate and form myelin sheaths around nerve axons is of interest for the prevention and treatment of myelin-associated diseases. In many cases, OLPs fail to mature and, therefore, they cannot remyelinate axons in dys- and de-myelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease or after a traumatic injury. Moreover, a chronic lack of myelin leads to axonal transection.\n\nAs neurological impairments have been observed after human space journeys, e.g., intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), we have studied in previous papers the effects of artificial microgravity on cultured OLPs. Our first study using BrdU revealed that rodent and human OLPs displayed enhanced and sustained proliferation while they were in sim-µG with a concomitant shortening of the cell cycle. Moreover, these cells appeared to remember having been in µG and continued to proliferate more after having been placed in Earth’s gravity.\n\nMore recently, we studied the effects of space-µG on OLPs and found enhanced proliferation, yet some of them displayed incomplete cytokinesis. Moreover, based on the expression of stage-specific developmental markers, we discovered that these cells came back in a more immature stage than that of the ground control OLPs. Here we sought to determine A) the impact of space flight on the global metabolomic profile of the secretome produced by OLPs while in space-µG in order to start unraveling extracellular processes, as well as identifying gravitational-sensitive molecules, and B) the energetic status of OLPs after space flight. We found the presence of some gravitational-sensitive molecules, as well as enhanced energy and glutamate metabolism in the secretome generated while the OLPs were on board the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, we found an elevated energy demand in the OLPs upon return to Earth, which led to an increased use of glycolysis to support their energy demands.\n\nIn previous decades, we have studied and developed culture conditions for OLs and their precursors using biochemical, histochemical and morphological signals. Key features of OLs are their well-defined developmental stages characterized by the expression of numerous stage-specific markers from which their expression is either transient or permanent throughout the life of these cells. These markers also define the functions that OLs support, including the production and secretion of the iron carrier glycoprotein transferrin for its autocrine and paracrine use in CNS iron metabolism, as well as the synthesis of all myelin components when OLs mature until they reach the myelinating stage. These stages and markers have been reported and reviewed by us and other scientists. For the purpose of understanding the contents of the secretome produced by space-flown OLPs, here we use our previous description of these developmental stages (Supplementary Figure S1).",
  "methods": "2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Culture System for OLPs and Pre-Myelinating OLs\n\nFor the present study, we used human induced pluripotent (hiPS)-derived OLPs. Four years prior to the space flight, we established a culture system with a homogeneous population of NSCs that was obtained from the original hiPS cell line “CS83iCTR-33-n1” (fibroblasts), “reprogrammed” and provided to us by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center via a material transfer agreement. We then prepared embryoid bodies and subsequently converted them to “OLPs” using the protocol previously described by Espinosa-Jeffrey et al.. For the purpose of this study, we used the oligodendrocyte specification medium (OSM), whose composition is shown in Table 1. This medium was used for pre-flight and during the experiment on board the ISS. The return medium is named BS1; to prepare BS1, we used OSM without N2 and B-27 and added Insulin Growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (Table 1).\n\n2.2. Hardware and Space Flight\n\nOLPs grow optimally at a pH of 7.4; the culture medium was buffered with HEPES and its pH was adjusted to 7.4 for the space flight. The culture medium that fed the cells during the ascent to space was recovered automatically from the cell chamber. Subsequently, the fresh medium in tank 1 fed the OLPs while onboard the ISS for 26 days, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n2.3. Secretome Metabolomics\n\nMetabolic profiles were obtained for each individual group using the Metabolon Platform (Metabolon). Briefly, each sample or “group” consisted of 5 biological replicate specimens per group. Three groups of samples were compared: OSM 26D (n = 5), which consisted of the culture medium alone incubated in the same conditions and the hardware used for our cell cultures, 1G OLPs (n = 5) maintained in Earth gravity, and SPC OLPs (n = 5). Post-harvest, the conditioned medium was used to analyze, in a comparative manner, the molecules secreted by the OLPs in both conditions. This medium was subjected to methanol extraction, then split into aliquots for analysis via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) in the positive (two methods), negative or polar ion mode. Metabolites were identified via the automated comparison of ion features to a reference library of chemical standards, followed by visual inspection for quality control, as previously described. Compound Identification: Raw data was extracted, peak-identified and QC processed. Biochemical identifications are based on three criteria: retention index within a narrow RI window of the proposed identification, accurate mass match to the library +/− 10 ppm, and the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the experimental data and authentic standards. The retention time/index (RI), mass to charge ratio (m/z), and chromatographic data (including MS/MS spectral data) are used simultaneously to distinguish and differentiate biochemicals. The MS/MS scores are based on the comparison of ions present in the experimental spectrum to the ions present in the library spectrum. While there may be similarities between these molecules based on just one of these factors, the use of all three data points simultaneously, provides more accuracy for the identification of the biochemicals. The repertoire of “standards”, consisting of 3300 purified molecules, is available for this type of analysis.\n\nFor structurally unnamed biochemical, mass spectral entries have been created and identified by virtue of their recurrent nature (both chromatographic and mass spectral). The asterisk in figures indicates that this compound has been identified based on two of the three characteristics mentioned above. Compounds identified in this manner, have the potential for their future identification by classical structural analysis. Alternatively, a new standard may be added to the library and the biochemical name confirmed.\n\n2.4. Statistical Analysis for the Metabolomics Study\n\nTo determine the statistical significance, Welsh’s two-sample t-tests were performed on the SPC, 1G and control medium groups of n = 5 in ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) or “R” to compare data between them; p < 0.05 was considered significant (Array Studio, RRID:SCR_010970). The false discovery rate (Q-value) was calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies, with Q < 0.05 used as an indication of high confidence in a result. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) were performed in ArrayStudio. Random forest analysis was performed as described. For the box plots, whiskers reflect the 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying the 25th to 75th quartiles); the bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” represents the population mean,. We only considered the molecules that presented a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the groups shown, with a metabolite ratio of <1.00.\n\n2.5. Launch to the ISS\n\nThe Bioscience-4 mission launched onboard the Space-X 21 Dragon capsule on 6 December 2020. This is the first study to investigate the proliferation of human normal hiPS-derived OLPs in space microgravity. For space flight, the OLPs were seeded onto passive 8-well Petri dishes from Airbus–Kiwi (Friedrichshafen, Germany) on floating mesh carriers measuring 2 mm × 2 mm, to which the cells adhered firmly; this feature was necessary to ensure that the cells would not detach and die during launching or while returning to Earth. The OLPs were flown to the ISS and installed in the Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 (STAaRS F-1) at 37 °C. The cells remained onboard the ISS for 39 days and 9 h and then returned to Earth (Figure 2).\n\n2.6. Cellular Bioenergetics\n\nUpon return from space, we ascertained a drop of pH from 7.4 to 7.1, which should represent the negligible effect of CO2 levels on the cells’ metabolism. For the assay, the OLPs were seeded onto an XF24 Cell Culture Microplate (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 5 × 104 cells per well in OSM. The cells were kept for 24 h in standard culture conditions (37 °C, 4.5% CO2). The following day, the wells were filled with fresh OSM. The following day, some of the supernatant was removed from the well plates. We used an XF24 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA) to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). The OCR and ECAR reflect the rates of cellular respiration and glycolysis, respectively. Measurements were performed with the cells in unbuffered Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 1 mM of pyruvate, 2 mM of glutamine, and 25 mM of glucose. Measures were recorded before (basal reading) and after the sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone/myxothiazol. The mitochondrial respiration was the difference between the total and rotenone/myxothiazol response. The maximal OCR was the response to the FCCP, whereas the maximal ECAR was the response to oligomycin. Values were normalized to the cellular protein concentration, determined with the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in all experiments.",
  "results": "3. Results\n\n3.1. Global Profile of the Secretome from the Different Treatments\n\nSecretomes of the OLPs kept for 26 days in 1G (1G OLP 26D) or SPC (SPC OLP 26D) were compared to the reference medium (OSM alone), using five biological replicates (see Section 2). Their mass spectra were globally examined, then compared one by one for the intensity of their components’ signals, to evidence a specific profile for each of these groups. Altogether, 424 signals were recorded, among which 372 were identified. Table 2 compares in a global way the mass spectra of the two groups of secretomes to those of the OSM alone. They display differences in the number of signals whose intensity is modified. There were more metabolites that increased in the presence of cells (157 and 182 in 1G and SPC, respectively; p < 0.05) compared to decreased metabolites (90 and 55 in 1G and SPC, respectively; p < 0.05). Importantly, there were 136 metabolites that increased and 62 metabolites that decreased in SPC vs. 1G. Thus, after 26 days, an increase was observed for ca. 60% of the signals present in the secretome of the cells kept in 1G, while this increase was of ca. 40% in space; when these secretomes are compared to the OSM, a larger number of metabolites was secreted at normal gravity than in its absence. The osmolality box plot represents the cumulative signal intensities in cell secretomes. The osmolality was higher in the presence of cells than in the media alone, and was increased in the cells at 0G compared to 1G (Figure 3A). Altogether, these results indicate a quantitative and qualitative variation in the secretome of cells at 0G compared to 1G. These changes in intensity do not equally affect all signals: the plot in Figure 3B (random forest analysis) shows the top metabolites (notably amino acids and xenobiotics) differentiating the OSM 26D medium from the secretomes, either in 1G or SPC conditions.\n\n3.2. Glycolysis and Energy-Related Metabolism\n\nThe comparison of the control medium and the secretomes from the OLPs grown in SPC or 1G shows that the SPC OLPs secreted about half of the pyruvate and phosphates of the 1G OLPs, suggesting the high energy requirements of OLPs in space. Both the SPC and 1G secretomes contained elevated levels of lactate, citrate, aconitate and malate vs. OSM but at levels between 1G and SPC, indicating a comparable metabolism in the first part of the TCA cycle. In contrast, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate and malate displayed increased levels in both the SPC and 1G secretomes, but with a larger increase in SPC, suggesting a change in glutaminolysis and/or a BCCA catabolism influx in SPC compared to 1G (see TCA cycle, Figure 4. The scaled intensity figures illustrate how the 1G and SPC secretomes differ for their contents in pyruvate and fumarate. Pyruvate (a product of the glutamate pathway) is one of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production and it was decreased in the OLPs flown to space. It fuels the TCA cycle (glycolysis pathway scheme), which generates energy (stored as phosphorylated and reduced coenzymes), while fumarate and malate are end products in this cycle (Table 3 and Figure 4), as already reported.\n\n3.3. Differences in Glutamate Metabolism\n\nThe detected metabolites were classified by their metabolic identity. Our present data confirm that OLs secrete glutamate metabolites into their milieu: α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), (1G), glutamine, and other glutamate derivatives were released at a high level in both 1G and SPC conditions vs. OSM; among those, the release was 40 to 55% higher in space for glutamine, glutamate and α-KG, while 4-hydroxy- and ß-citryl-glutamate derivatives were lower (20–30%). N-acetyl-glutamate was lower in the 1G medium than in OSM but higher in SPC vs. OSM, suggesting a shift from uptake to secretion in 1G to SPC. The scaled intensity block diagrams for glutamate, glutamine and α-KG illustrate that the three of them are released by the cells, and that this release is accentuated by SPC (Figure 5).\n\n3.4. Differences in Lipid Metabolism\n\nGlycerophosphate lipids (phospholipids) generated higher signals in the cell secretomes and were more secreted by SPC cells vs. 1G cells, consistent with previous observations. However, phosphatidyl-cholines with short chains of unsaturated fatty acids and lysophospholipids (non myelin-specific species) were also more detected in cell secretome, but at a lower level in SPC than 1G. In the case of sphingomyelins, their levels of secretion were similar between the 1G and SPC OLPs. Taken together, these observations indicate that our OLPs have their developmental program at the very least delayed in the absence of gravity (Figure 6).\n\n3.5. Space Flight Elicits Higher Respiration Rates in hiPS-Derived OLPs\n\nIn order to ascertain the effects of space-µG on energy metabolism, we compared 1G OLPs and SPC OLPs. We quantified the OCR and ECAR as measures of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, respectively. We found that five days after splashdown, the SPC OLPs presented significantly higher basal, mitochondrial and maximal respiration when compared with the 1G OLPs, suggesting a higher mitochondria-dependent energy demand. In contrast, the glycolysis differences were not statistically significant (Figure 7).",
