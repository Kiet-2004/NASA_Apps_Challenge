  "abstract": "Significance\n\nDeteriorating health across the life course is a major societal burden, and effective therapeutics are lacking. Mitochondrial decline has long been associated with age-related health loss. We show that small, clinically meaningful doses of a mitochondrion-targeting sulfur donor (AP39) extend Caenorhabditis elegans health in older age, which act by maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Adult onset of AP39 delivery, when mitochondrial and cell structural dysfunction are already manifested, also promoted healthy aging. Distinct association of health span extension with mitochondria, cytoskeletal and peroxisome molecular profiles, under regulation of the elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor regulatory circuit, further distinguished adult-onset AP39 therapy. Our results establish a framework for forward translating mitochondrial sulfide as a potentially viable healthy aging intervention in mammals.\n\nLiving longer without simultaneously extending years spent in good health (“health span”) is an increasing societal burden, demanding new therapeutic strategies. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can correct disease-related mitochondrial metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H2S concentrations can pro health span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecules (mtH2S) administered across the adult life course are unknown. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans aging model, we compared untargeted H2S (NaGYY4137, 100 µM and 100 nM) and mtH2S (AP39, 100 nM) donor effects on life span, neuromuscular health span, and mitochondrial integrity. H2S donors were administered from birth or in young/middle-aged animals (day 0, 2, or 4 postadulthood). RNAi pharmacogenetic interventions and transcriptomics/network analysis explored molecular events governing mtH2S donor-mediated health span. Developmentally administered mtH2S (100 nM) improved life/health span vs. equivalent untargeted H2S doses. mtH2S preserved aging mitochondrial structure, content (citrate synthase activity) and neuromuscular strength. Knockdown of H2S metabolism enzymes and FoxO/daf-16 prevented the positive health span effects of mtH2S, whereas DCAF11/wdr-23 – Nrf2/skn-1 oxidative stress protection pathways were dispensable. Health span, but not life span, increased with all adult-onset mtH2S treatments. Adult mtH2S treatment also rejuvenated aging transcriptomes by minimizing expression declines of mitochondria and cytoskeletal components, and peroxisome metabolism hub components, under mechanistic control by the elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor circuit. H2S health span extension likely acts at the mitochondrial level, the mechanisms of which dissociate from life span across adult vs. developmental treatment timings. The small mtH2S doses required for health span extension, combined with efficacy in adult animals, suggest mtH2S is a potential healthy aging therapeutic.",
  "introduction": "Medical advances mean humans are living longer but are also spending longer in a frail “poor health” state, with large burdens on healthcare systems and quality of life. Since most age-related healthcare costs and patient frailty occur in the later years of life, interventions that increase life span without simultaneously increasing health span would be detrimental to the aging process. Studies often report life span–extending therapeutics in lower organisms, but a significant caveat is the general assumption that increasing longevity also prolongs the duration spent in a healthy state (termed “health span”). While it is largely unknown whether most conditions that extend life span also increase health span, evidence indicates dissociation between the two. For example, all long-lived Caenorhabditis elegans mutants examined to date spend a longer time in an aged frail condition; the same phenomenon reported in long-living humans. Therapeutic approaches that extend healthy years, rather than life span alone, thus hold considerable socioeconomic potential.\n\nHydrogen sulfide (H2S) was one of the essential ingredients required for life to emerge on Earth and has emerged as an important, physiologically relevant signaling molecule. When applied exogenously, H2S treatments, usually in the form of crude impure sulfide salts at supraphysiological concentrations (e.g. >100 µM), confer cytoprotective properties across various pathophysiological states, including age-associated diseases. Accordingly, 100 to 150 µM concentrations of untargeted H2S donors such as GYY4137 and FW1256 extend both life span and health span in C. elegans when administered from birth. However, several essential biochemical processes are established during development that program subsequent adult behavior. For example, developmental starvation cements locomotion circuitry that impacts adult foraging behavior, and developmentally established mitochondrial dynamics determine rates of adult respiration and aging. Additionally, life-extending mitochondrial interventions in C. elegans currently require administration on or before the developmental larval stages. Metabolic patterns set during developmental H2S treatments might, therefore, mediate life span and health span extension. The efficacy of H2S administered during “normal” stochastic aging thus warrants investigation to understand the viability of adult H2S-based therapies.\n\nSeveral cellular processes are responsive to H2S that can regulate H2S-mediated longevity, yet the mechanisms governing H2S-mediated health span are undefined. Increasing evidence supports a mitochondrion-centric mode of H2S action across cell types and pathologies. Current dogma suggests H2S donates electrons to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inhibits mitochondrial cAMP phosphodiesterases, facilitates mitochondrial DNA repair, promotes mitochondrial antioxidant protection, and augments mitochondrial respiration/ATP production (reviewed in ref.). Moreover, mitochondrial loss is one of the nine hallmarks of aging and is the earliest detectable subcellular structural change during C. elegans aging, preceding physiological decline. As such, therapies that exploit positive H2S effects on mitochondria represent an attractive antiaging strategy. The mitochondrial sulfide delivery molecule (mtH2S), AP39, exploits mitochondrial membrane potential by utilizing a TPP+ motif to localize H2S to the mitochondria and protect against cellular injury [e.g., glucose oxidase–induced mitochondrial dysfunction ] vs. equal doses of untargeted H2S donors. Consequently, unlike untargeted H2S compounds (e.g., GYY4137, FW1256) with supraphysiological effective doses, mtH2S displays potency at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower in C. elegans disease models. Whether such phenomena occur in the aging context is unknown; however, mtH2S is plausibly responsible for longevity and health span extension reported following larger untargeted H2S doses.\n\nThis study, therefore, investigated the efficacy of a mtH2S (AP39) for promoting health span via mitochondrion-mediated effects vs. untargeted H2S donors, using C. elegans as an aging model. Given the unknown capacity of H2S as an efficacious therapy in aging adults, we also examined health span effects of adult-onset H2S treatments. Using functional pharmacogenetic approaches, we provide evidence that mtH2S is a requirement for, and site of action of, H2S-mediated health span promotion. Importantly, mtH2S increases health span when administered to young and middle-aged adults, and this adult treatment effect is clearly reflected at the transcriptomic level compared to developmental mtH2S administration, under the control of a GATA family of transcription factors. These findings strongly suggest that augmentation of mitochondrial sulfide may represent a druggable target and translatable therapeutic approach to maintaining health with advancing age, at time points where the negative effects of aging already manifest.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nC. elegans Maintenance and Experiment Design.\n\nThe strains used in this study were N2 wild-type and CB5600 (ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3::Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3::Mtgfp)) and were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre (CGC, University of Minnesota). For maintenance, C. elegans were cultured at 20 °C on OP50 E. coli seeded NGM agar plates, as previously described. For all experiments, the first day of adulthood was considered as Day 0.\n\nFor drug exposure experiments, unless stated otherwise, L1 worms synchronized by gravity floatation were cultured at 20 °C on OP50 E. coli seeded NGM plates containing either 100 nM AP39 + 0.01% DMSO, 100 nM or 100 mM NaGYY4137, 0.01% DMSO or no drug. The mitochondrion-targeted H2S donor compound, AP39, was synthesized in-house by the Whiteman lab, as previously described. The NaGYY4137 untargeted H2S donor compound was also synthesized in-house. Compound solutions were freshly prepared for every use and added to plates the evening before animal transfers. For developmental treatments, drug dosing was started from the L1 larval stage and continued throughout the life course. For adult drug treatments, gravity synchronized L1 larvae were grown on NGM agar seeded with OP50 only for 60 h to reach young adulthood, after which drug treatments were started at either day 0, day 2, or day 4 postadulthood. Adult animals were transferred every 48 h to fresh plates to remove progeny and maintain consistent food and drug concentrations.\n\nSurvival Assay and Measures of C. elegans Locomotion and Maximal Strength Production.\n\nAdult animals were scored and transferred to fresh plates every 48 h. The animals were scored as dead when they failed to move in response to stimulus with a needle. Animals that were lost, killed during transfer, or died as a result of (e.g.) egg laying defects were censored. Total animal numbers were n = 300 per condition, across three biological replicates. Locomotion assays were performed using WMicrotracker and maximal strength production was assessed using the ‘NemaFlex’ microfluidic device (36) (See SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods).\n\nMitochondrial and Myofibrillar Imaging.\n\nMitochondria within body wall muscle cells of the CB5600 (ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3::Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3::Mtgfp)) strain were imaged using an Olympus CKX41 microscope (Olympus UK Ltd. London). The worms were imaged by GFP fluorescence microscopy at 40× magnification. Approximately 20 to 30 animals per condition were placed in 20 µL M9 on a microscope slide and immobilized with a cover slip. Images were taken of myofibers or mitochondria in body-wall muscle from both head and tail regions of every animal and visually classified as either well-networked, moderately fragmented, or severely fragmented (for mitochondrial quantification), or organized, moderately disorganized, and severely disorganized (for myofibrillar quantification) as previously described. The overall proportion of mitochondrial or myofibrillar classifications was obtained by normalizing to the total muscle cell count within each treatment condition (~150 to 300 muscle cells per condition from 30 to 60 animals per time point) across two biological replicates.\n\nMeasurement of Citrate Synthase Activity.\n\nWild-type N2 animals were roughly age synchronized as previously described and grown for ~60 h to young adulthood on fresh OP50 bacterial lawns 20 °C. Animals were transferred to fresh OP50 plates every 48 h to remove progeny and prevent population starvation, and 50 animals collected per condition, per time point (days 0, 2, 4, and 12 postadulthood) and per replicate. Citrate synthase activity (CS) was measured in isolated mitochondrial pellets, as described in Supplemental methods section.\n\nRNA Interference Protocols.\n\nAll RNAi experiments were performed using age synchronized L1 larval stage animals by gravity flotation and grown for 60 h on NGM agar plates containing 1 mM IPTG, 50 µg/mL ampicillin. The plates were seeded with 200 μL HT115 (DE3) bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA against the genes screened. The Ahringer RNAi library was utilized, purchased from Source Bioscience (Cambridge, UK). HT115 (DE3) bacteria containing the empty L4440 plasmid vector was used as controls. Full details of each RNAi protocol for health span/life span screens, or plate-based experiments can be viewed in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section.\n\nRNA Isolation for Next-Generation Sequencing.\n\nSynchronized worms were grown on NGM agar plates until young adulthood and treated with AP39 mtH2S from either L1 or day 0, as described above. On sample collection day, 100 worms were manually picked and added to 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermofisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) prior to RNA extractions (see SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section for details).\n\nRNA-seq Data Analyses.\n\nAfter RNA sequencing data preprocessing (see SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section), the DESeq2 package for R was used to test for differential gene expression. Establishing approaches to adaptive shrinkage methods and control for false discovery rate (FDR) were employed. DEGreport R was applied to normalized counts to group by expression profile any gene differentially regulated between treatments and/or time points. Functional enrichment analysis of defined gene clusters was then undertaken using the gprofiler2 package for R. Each gene cluster was also input into the Online Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING, v11.5; ref.) to infer respective PPI networks. Full details of the bioinformatic pipeline employed are provided in Supplemental methods section.\n\n7-azido-4-Methylcoumarin Measures of Total Sulfide Levels.\n\nIn all, 120 animals were picked into M9 buffer in 1.5 mL low-bind eppendorphs and washed three times with 1 mL sterile M9 to clear bacterial debris and progeny. Samples were snap-frozen in 40 µL M9 and stored at −80 °C until analysis (within 1 wk). Sulfide content was assessed as described previously as described in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section.\n\nELT-6 Fluorescent Reporter Quantification.\n\nThe SD1550 strain harboring an elt-6 fluorescent promoter and mitochondrial GFP (ccIs4251 [(pSAK2) myo-3p::GFP::LacZ::NLS + (pSAK4) myo-3p::mitochondrial GFP + dpy-20(+)] I. stIs10178 [elt-6p::HIS-24::mCherry + unc-119(+)] was imaged on an upright epifluorescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK). All elt-6 images were taken with mCherry fluorescence at 500-ms exposure and GFP fluorescence set to 50-ms exposure for mitochondrial images. Single images were taken from the head for ELT-6, as the sole site of ELT-6 reporter expression pattern, and from head and tail regions for mitochondrial characterisation across 40-60 animals per condition, per time point. Mitochondrial images were analyzed as detailed above, and ELT-6 images were quantified in ImageJ by performing integrated density quantification on each fluorescent image, subtracting background fluorescence.\n\nMitochondrial Toxic Stress Assays in ELT-6 Transgenic Reporter Animals.\n\nAge-synchronized SD1550 animals were grown to young adulthood on 33-mm NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. Approximately 30 day 0 adults where then picked into 40 μL of either 100 μM hydrogen peroxide (Sigma, UK; 7722-84-1) or 5 mM sodium arsenite (Santa Cruz, DE; 7784-46-5) diluted in M9 for 1- and 2-h exposures, respectively. For rotenone and antimycin A exposures, animals were picked into 40 μL 50 μM or 100 μM concentrations, respectively, diluted in 20 mg/mL OP50/NGM bacteria and incubated for 4 h. Tubes where then washed three times with M9 before animals were pipetted onto slides and immobilized by a coverslip. Both ELT-6 and mitochondrial images were then captured and analyzed as detailed above.\n\nMitochondrial Superoxide Assessment.\n\nSuperoxide levels were measured using MitoSOX (Invitrogen, UK) as described previously. For day 0 measures, animals were grown on OP50 plates until L3 larval stage, where ~30 animals were then picked onto petri plates + OP50 seeded with a final plate concentration of 10 μM MitoSOX and left to incubate in the dark for 24 h. The same exposures were performed for day 4 and day 10 measures (i.e., day 3 and day 9 adults picked onto MitoSOX plates for 24 h, respectively). On the day of imaging, animals were washed from plates with M9 buffer into 1.5 mL low-bind tubes and washed three times to clear the outer cuticle of probe. Animals were then placed on OP50 plates for 1-h to clear residual probe from the gut. Animals were then picked into 20 μL M9 buffer on glass slides with glass coverslip. Images were taken with a 40× objective with green light excitation and a 1-s exposure rate. The terminal bulb was manually selected in ImageJ and integrated fluorescence density was normalized to the total area of analysis and background fluorescence removed.\n\nStatistics and Data Analysis.\n\nStatistics and graph generation were performed in GraphPad Prism 9. Significance was determined by paired t test or 2-way ANOVA, with post hoc multiple comparison tests. For survival analyses, the Log-Rank (Mantel Cox) test was used.\n\nData, Materials, and Software Availability\n\nAll study data are included in the article and/or supporting information. The raw RNA sequencing data can be found within the NCBI BioProject database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/) under the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession PRJNA996496.",
  "results": "Results\n\nmtH2S Increases C. elegans Life span and Neuromuscular Health span.\n\nWe first investigated the effects of mitochondrion-targeted and nontargeted H2S donors on C. elegans life span. Dosing L1 larvae with the untargeted sulfide donor NaGYY4137 (100 µM) increased maximal life span by 20 % (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A), which is comparable to previous studies using GYY4137 (morpholine salt) and related compounds. In sharp contrast, the mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecule (mtH2S) AP39 significantly increased life span at 1000-fold lower doses (100 nM) by 30% (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1B), whereas equivalent 100 nM doses of untargeted NaGYY4137 had no significant effect on C. elegans life span extension (Fig. 1A).\n\nWe next assessed movement rates on days 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 of life span as a robust proxy of overall animal health and, therefore, health span. Using wMicroTracker to measure prolonged movement capacity beyond standard thrash assays, wild-type movement capacity peaked at day 4 of adulthood (+97% vs. day 0 baseline), as previously published, and progressively declined thereafter to a nadir of −26% at day 16 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). At greatly different doses, 100 µM NaGYY4137 H2S and 100 nM mtH2S increased total animal movement rates across the life course (P < 0.001), using area under the curve analysis of movement across the life course, as previously published (Fig. 2A). Post hoc analysis showed significant health span extension in mtH2S (100 nM)-treated animals up to day 16 postadulthood compared to day 12 postadulthood during NaGYY4137 treatments (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Loss of neuromuscular strength is also one of the strongest correlates of all-cause mortality in humans, leading us to employ our “NemaFlex” device to examine neuromuscular strength changes across age. As with movement rates (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), wild-type strength capacity increased between days 0 and 4 adulthood and declined thereafter. Conversely, treatment with mtH2S (100 nM) improved strength production across days 0–10 postadulthood (P < 0.001), with a significant 20% strength increase vs. wild-type at day 10 (Fig. 2B). Additionally, while the observed effect sizes of mtH2S are comparable to those reported for other life span–extending compounds, the improvements we observed are modest. We, therefore, directly compared mtH2S to a recently published life span and health span improving drug, rilmenidine, using our microfluidic “Nemalife” health span device, and found both compounds extended life span and health span to similar degrees using our microfluidic approach (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Rilmendine also has no effect on neuromuscular health parameters in early life but rather manifest in older age time points, as observed herein for mtH2S. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that H2S effects on health span are likely mediated through mitochondrial effects which, although modest, may be highly beneficial, since aging is also associated with a later life loss of prolonged movement and strength-producing capacity.\n\nmtH2S Maintains Mitochondrial Structure and Content.\n\nGiven the well-established role of mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related health decline across species, we examined whether mtH2S health span promotion associated with maintained mitochondrial integrity. Using green fluorescent protein-tagged mitochondrion transgenic animals to compare lower dose mtH2S (100 nM) to higher dose untargeted H2S (100 µM), mitochondrial structure was scored as either well networked, or moderately fragmented. Well-networked mitochondria at day 0 of adulthood presented in 88% of wild-type animals, which was not affected by either mtH2S or untargeted H2S treatments. In line with previous reports, by day 2 postadulthood well-networked mitochondria reduced to 21% in wild-type worms. The number of well-networked mitochondria increased threefold with mtH2S treatment at day 2 of adulthood, and twofold with untargeted H2S (P < 0.001). Only mtH2S significantly sustained mitochondrial integrity at day 4 postadulthood (Fig. 3A). In wild-type animals, the number of moderately fragmented mitochondria increased progressively from day 2 of adulthood (21% of animals), reaching 86% by day 16. Comparable delays in moderate mitochondrial fragmentation were observed between mtH2S and untargeted H2S from days 8 to 12 postadulthood, whereas only mtH2S supressed moderate fragmentation up to day 14 of adulthood (Fig. 3B). We also assessed citrate synthase activity (CS) as a marker of mitochondrial health, which correlates with mitochondrial content, biosynthesis, and cristae area. Untargeted H2S failed to induce a significant effect on CS across the life course. Conversely, mtH2S significantly increased CS throughout life span, and to a greater extent than untargeted H2S (up to day 12, P < 0.0001), with significant increases in CS presenting up to day 4, but not day 12 of life span (Fig. 3E). To confirm that differences in H2S bioavailability does not underpin the improved efficacy of mtH2S vs. untargeted H2S for maintaining mitochondrial structure and content, we assessed total animal sulfide levels and found no difference with either compound at day 4 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Thus, mtH2S improves mitochondrial integrity across age, which associates with health span maintenance.\n\nAP39-Mediated Health span Extension Requires H2S Metabolism and FoxO Pathways, but Not Nrf2 Oxidative Stress Protection.\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to regulate longevity in response to exogenous H2S, yet the mechanisms governing health span extension are unknown. To probe this, we performed a hypothesis-driven RNAi gene knockdown and a mtH2S pharmacogenetic screen, using a microfluidic life span machine to assess animal health every day of the life course. First, we examined the requirement for enzymes controlling endogenous H2S synthesis: cytosolic cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS/cbs-1) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE/cth-2), and cytoplasmic/mitochondrial 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST/mpst-1). Corroborating previous reports, we found that cth-2 knockdown alone had no effect on life span and knocking down cbs-1 or mpst-1 shortened life span (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Knockdown of cth-2 also did not significantly affect health span, whereas knockdown of cbs-1 and mpst-1 RNAi both impaired health span (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Cotreatment of RNAi against cth-2, cbs-1 or mpst-1 with mtH2S from L1 stage prevented the positive effects of mtH2S on life span and health span (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). While exogenous mtH2S might be anticipated to bypass endogenous H2S biosynthesis pathways, analysis of total animal sulfide levels confirmed a need for functional H2S producing enzymes, since mtH2S-induced sulfide increases in older age were ablated when combined with cth-2, mpst-1 or cbs-1 RNAi (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Combined with the loss of mtH2S-induced life span and health span extension with knockdown of the H2S synthesizing enzymes kri-1 and cysl-2 (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4), the H2S synthesis system is a general requirement for the positive effects of mtH2S donors on C. elegans health and longevity.\n\nWe next examined the potential involvement of enzymes involved in wider H2S metabolism: ETHE1/ethe-1, a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase necessary for H2S catabolism, and GSR/gsr-1, a glutathione reductase involved in H2S-mediated production of glutathione. Knockdown of ethe-1 alone did not affect life span but significantly increased health span and, when combined with mtH2S, prevented mtH2S-induced life span and health span extension. Because ethe-1 catabolizes H2S, we postulated that harmful H2S accumulation might occur following combined exogenous mtH2S administration. Examining the dose response (1nM to 2 µM) of mtH2S + ethe-1 knockdown revealed no further decline in animal health span, however life span became shortened at higher (100 nM to 2 µM) doses (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Both life span and health span were reduced following gsr-1 knockdown, which also inhibited life/health span extension with concurrent mtH2S treatment. Additionally, the FoxO/daf-16 transcription factor has been implicated in H2S life span extension, and we observed lowered life span and health span with daf-16 knockdown alone, corroborating previous reports. mtH2S did not increase life span or health span in animals subjected to daf-16 RNAi (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4).\n\nH2S also regulated cellular redox homeostasis, in part through activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor and associated signaling pathway. We, therefore, knocked down Nrf2/skn-1 or DCAF11/wdr-23 as a negative upstream regulator of Nrf2. In line with previous reports skn-1 knockdown animals were short lived, whereas wdr-23 deficient worms were longer lived. Both skn-1 and wdr-23 RNAi also resulted in extended health span. Agreeing with earlier studies showing a need for the Nrf2 system for H2S-induced C. elegans life span extension, we also observed prevention of mtH2S increases in life span with combined skn-1 or wdr-23 knockdown. Despite this, our findings reveal that the Nrf2 system is not required for mtH2S-associated health span extension. We observed this same phenomenon with other components of the Nrf2 pathway, including the Nrf2-controlled glutamate–cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, GCLC/gcs-1. Only the Nrf2 nuclear translocation regulatory factor RelA/ikke-1 attenuated mtH2S health span improvements (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Our data strongly suggest that the positive health span effects of mtH2S were not dependent on the Nrf2 signaling system.\n\nLast, we investigated the role of two H2S-responsive candidates, the mitochondrion-located heat shock protein chaperone HSPA9/hsp-6, and the hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF1A/ hif-1. Knockdown of both hsp-6 or hif-1 significantly increased life span and health span, and combined gene knockdown with mtH2S did not impact the life span and health span promoting effects of mtH2S (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4).\n\nAdult Treatments with mtH2S Extend Health span, but Not Life span.\n\nLife span and health span extension have only been previously reported with untargeted H2S continuously administered from L1 larval stage until death. We, therefore, treated animals with low (100 nM) dose AP39 or 1000-fold higher (100 µM) dose NaGYY4137, starting in either day 0 young adults, day 2 of adulthood (chosen as the time point of mitochondrial fragmentation onset, Fig. 4A and ref.), or day 4 of adulthood [chosen as the time point when tissue structural integrity begins to decline ]. Both mtH2S and untargeted H2S donors were ineffective at increasing animal life span when administered from day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P > 0.05). Conversely, health span was significantly increased by mtH2S when administered from either day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P < 0.01) and was also increased with untargeted H2S treatments starting from days 2 or 4 postadulthood (P < 0.05), but not in day 0 young adults (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Additionally, mtH2S administered from day 0 adulthood significantly increased the number of normally arrayed mitochondria at days 4 and 10 postadulthood, and improved sarcomere organization at day 10 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). Providing further evidence that improved mitochondrial health underpins mtH2S health improvements, we also found significantly lower mitochondrial superoxide levels during aging with adult mtH2S treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Health span was thus extended when mtH2S was delivered to adult animals, at time points where key aging subcellular defects occur, and is reflected in delayed onset of age-related dystrophic muscle and dysfunctional mitochondria.\n\nAdult mtH2S Treatments Maintain Mitochondrion- and Peroxisome-Enriched Transcriptomes in Later Life.\n\nTo better understand the molecules governing life span and health span responsiveness to mtH2S, we performed next-generation sequencing on animals treated with mtH2S from L1 larvae or from day 0 of adulthood. Principal component analysis revealed distinct features of C. elegans transcriptomes across days 0, 4, and 10 postadulthood. Moreover, mtH2S-treated animals displayed similar gene features to wild-type at day 0 and 4 of adulthood. Divergence from wild-type presented in older day 10 animals, with a shift toward day 4 features in mtH2S treatments, particularly when treated from day 0 young adulthood (Fig. 5A). Consistent with principal component analysis, global transcriptomic dysregulation at day 10 postadulthood was reduced in animals treated with mtH2S at adult onset only (Fig. 5B). Next, clustering of differentially expressed genes using expression profiles identified four most prominent differentially expressed gene clusters (i.e., clusters containing >200 differentially expressed genes). Two of these (Clusters 8 and 14) exhibited an elevated expression profile in later life (day 10 postadulthood) that was suppressed with adult onset mtH2S but unaffected by mtH2S administered from birth (L1 stage), and were functionally associated with FoxO, proteolytic, mitophagy, and ribosome translational processes (Fig. 5 C and D). Analyzing the top 10 ranked protein–protein interaction (PPI) network hub nodes for each cluster identified daf-2-responsive F-box genes (fbxb-41, fbxb-54, fbxb-91, M116.1, pes-2.2, T05D4.2, T25E12.6) and autophagy (C35E7.5) components as prominent cluster 8 hubs. Cluster 14 hubs aligned almost exclusively to nucleolus localized components (lpd-7, nol-6, nol-14, pro-3, rpl-24.2) involved in RNA-binding activity as part of the ribonucleoprotein complex (F49D11.10, rbm-28, toe-1, W09C5.1, Y45F10D.7). As with wider cluster expression profiles, gene expression of hub components was predominantly altered at day 10 older age and in response to adult mtH2S treatments only (Fig. 5E).\n\nMoreover, two gene clusters (Clusters 3 and 13) that aligned to cytoskeletal structure, mitochondria, and general metabolism functional classes, displayed progressive expression declines with age. In both clusters, mtH2S administered from L1 again failed to affect the age-related loss of gene expression. Conversely, adult-onset mtH2S treatment induced a strong maintenance of gene expression, emerging specifically in day 10 adults (Fig. 5 C and D). Additionally, this pattern of age-related gene expression changes remaining unaltered by L1 mtH2S administration, but rejuvenated by adult-onset mtH2S in later life emerged across nearly all other 27 gene clusters identified (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig. S10). Top ranked hubs for cluster 3 related mostly to muscle cytoskeletal proteins (C46G7.2, cpn-3, mlc-1, mup-2, tnt-2, unc-27), but included regulators of calcium homeostasis (csq-1) and glutathione transferase activity (gst-26). Within cluster 13, there was striking enrichment for hubs functionally associated with peroxisomal components (acox-1.1, acox-1.2, B0272.4, ctl-2, daf-22, dhs-28) and lysosomal cathepsin proteases (asp-1, asp-3). Again, only adult-onset mtH2S treatments appeared to attenuate the age-related reduction in gene expression of hub components, in older day 10 animals (Fig. 5E). To probe the mechanistic influence of these hub genes in the positive aging effects of adult-onset mtH2S, we examined the requirement of the peroxisomal catalase ctl-2 as the most strongly maintained hub gene across clusters 3, 8, 13, and 14 (Fig. 5E). RNAi knockdown of ctl-2 exacerbated early adult mitochondrial fragmentation and prevented the mtH2S-induced mitochondrial maintainance in early and later life (SI Appendix, Fig. S11), therein supporting the functional and mechanistic relevance of our identified transcriptomic targets.\n\nA GATA Transcription Factor Regulatory Circuit Underpins the Positive Aging Effects of mtH2S.\n\nWe next sought to examine the mechanistic role of genes responsive to mtH2S during aging; however, the clusters identified represent several dozen individual differentially expressed genes. We, therefore, employed transcription factor (TF)-binding site analysis to identify TFs predicted to commonly regulate the cytoskeletal (Cluster 3) and peroxisomal (Cluster 13) gene clusters that display mtH2S-induced preservation in older age. From this, a single transcription factor, elt-3 (part of a GATA family of transcription factors), emerged as the putative regulator of both gene clusters (Fig. 5D). During wild-type aging, expression of elt-5 and elt-6 increase which, in turn, repress expression of elt-3 to regulate a large portion of age-related transcriptome changes. Our untreated controls mirrored this response at the transcriptional level, and these expression changes are reversed by adult onset mtH2S (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Next, using transgenic animals coexpressing ELT-6 RFP and mitochondrial GFP reporters, we confirmed protein level ELT-6 upregulation during aging, which was suppressed by adult onset mtH2S treatment (Fig. 6 A and B), and corresponded with improved mitochondrial structure and movement rates (Fig. 6 C and D). Additionally, knockdown of either elt-6 or elt-3, while not affecting animal movement rate in middle age and older age, prevented mtH2S-induced movement increases (Fig. 6 E and F).\n\nTo verify the role of elt-6/elt-3, we examined the cytoskeleton (adherens junction) and mitochondrion-localized protein BAR-1/ β-catenin, loss of which is reported to upr-egulate gene clusters under regulation by elt-3 which would, therefore, be anticipated to also down-regulate ELT-6. Consistent with this model, we observed that bar-1 RNAi prevented age-related increases in ELT-6 expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Moreover, mtH2S did not synergistically lower age-related ELT-6 levels when combined with bar-1 RNAi (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), implying some functional association with mtH2S and bar-1/β-catenin (further supporting a role for mtH2S in modifiying the cytoskeleton via the elt-6/elt-3 circuit). While the precise causal mechanisms linking H2S-related mitochondrial improvements with the elt-6/elt-3 system and, subsequently, health span remains undefined, the mitochondrial mechanisms appear specific to the aging context; although we show aging mitochondrial decline and mtH2S acts through this TF circtuit, inducing acute severe mitochondrial decline via toxic drugs fails to activate ELT-6 despite major structural fragmentation of mitochondria (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Combined, our systems biological studies provide evidence that mtH2S improves mitochondrial health to alter elt-6/elt-3 TFs, which likely act as a reguatory circuit governing cytoskeletal and peroxisomal gene clusters to, ultimately, modify health span.",
