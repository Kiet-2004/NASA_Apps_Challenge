  "abstract": "Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans. C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE2 signaling in these phenotypes.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nCandida albicans is a commensal fungus that is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of roughly 65% of individuals. C. albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause oral thrush and life-threatening bloodstream infections. Because of the severity of these infections, C. albicans pathogenesis has been extensively investigated. However, prior to infections, C. albicans lives in the gut and can breach the GI tract to infect the host.\n\nOne host setting associated with enrichment for C. albicans in the GI tract is alcohol use disorder (AUD), a condition in which individuals have lost the ability to control or stop their alcohol consumption. Estimates suggest roughly 2.3 billion people in the world consume alcohol and over 5% of the world’s adult population has an AUD. C. albicans is enriched in the fecal microbiome in individuals with AUD and contributes to the progression and severity of ALD. Immune responses to intestinal fungi correlate with a reduced 5-year survival in those with ALD, showing that changes in abundance of intestinal fungi have vital consequences to the host.\n\nThe gut microbiota can also affect host behavior via effects on the gut-brain axis (GBA). The GBA is defined as the bidirectional communication between the GI tract and the brain. The GBA has been implicated in many disorders ranging from autism to addiction. Initial work characterizing the GBA in AUD found dysbiosis in the GI tract can contribute to depression and craving. Specific bacteria have been found that contribute to the control of factors crucial to alcohol craving. Further, fecal microbiota transplants in mice and humans can modulate ethanol preference and craving respectively. These findings support the model that changes to the microbiome in AUD can regulate ethanol consumption.\n\nAs a mechanism linking microbiome changes to the GBA in AUD, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an eicosanoid compound synthesized from arachidonic acid. A previous study showed that treatment with PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption in rats. Serum PGE2 levels have previously been shown to be higher in antibiotic-treated mice with GI colonization by C. albicans. Further, we previously showed that C. albicans colonization in mice dysregulated endocannabinoids, another set of compounds that utilize arachidonic acid as a precursor. The arachidonic acid-derived host lipidome is thus altered in C. albicans-colonized mice. We therefore tested for a role for PGE2 in reducing ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice.\n\nIn this study, we show that C. albicans GI colonization in mice reduced their ethanol consumption. C. albicans-colonized mice had elevated serum PGE2 compared to mock-colonized mice, and injection of uncolonized mice with dimethyl-PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption. The reduction in ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice was reversed by antagonizing receptors for PGE2. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum, a more rapid acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion, and were more sensitive to ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits which could be reversed by PGE2 receptor antagonist treatment. These results show for the first time that changes to the fungal microbiome can alter ethanol preference and ethanol-induced behavior in mice.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nAnimals\n\nFive-week-old female or male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimated to the facility and single-housing for 4–5 days with scruffing to acclimate to handling. Mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans at different times depending on the experiment. Mice were inoculated by pipetting 20uL containing 5×107 cells of C. albicans strain CKY101 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or PBS only for mock-colonized mice, directly into the mouth of the mouse as previously described. Mock-colonized mice were given 20uL of PBS directly into their mouths. Mice were monitored throughout the experiment for colonization as previously described. No fungal colonies were observed in mock-colonized mice.\n\nMouse weight was measured throughout the experiment. Rarely, if a mouse lost 20% of its starting body weight, the mouse was euthanized. On the last day of each experiment, mice were anesthetized using the isoflurane drop method and euthanized via decapitation. Blood for serum and various organs were harvested for analysis. All mouse experiments were approved by the Tufts IACUC and were performed in accordance with IACUC guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals.\n\nChemicals and Reagents\n\nThe EP1 antagonist SC-51089 (Cayman Chemical) and the EP2 antagonist TG6–10-1 (Cayman Chemical) were resuspended in 2:3:5 mixture of DMSO:sterile water:PEG400. Antagonists were resuspended and mixed at a concentration that would yield 2mg/kg of each antagonist in 50uL and 50 uL of the mixture was injected intraperitoneally.\n\nFifteen percent ethanol was prepared for consumption by diluting 95% ethanol (Fisher) with tap water. This solution was filter sterilized and added to sipper tubes for the two-bottle choice experiment.\n\n16,16-dimethyl Prostaglandin E2 (Cayman Chemical) was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen to evaporate the solvent. It was then resuspended in DMSO and injected into mice subcutaneously at a concentration of 25, 50, 100, or 300 ug/kg.\n\nTwo-Bottle Choice Ethanol or Saccharin Consumption\n\nDuring acclimation to the facility and single housing, mice also began acclimating to the sipper tubes used in the two-bottle choice experiment. Briefly, sterile acidified water was poured into 50 mL conical tubes (USA Scientific) and a sterile stopper (#6 Rubber, Ancare) with a sipper spout (Ancare) was placed into the 50 mL conical tube and wrapped with parafilm. Two of these sipper bottles with water were placed into standard cages for acclimation.\n\nFollowing acclimation, mice were weighed and assigned to groups with equal weights. Mice were inoculated with C. albicans or mock-inoculated on day −1. On day 0, 15% (vol/vol) ethanol or 0.0125% (wt/vol) saccharin replaced one water bottle. Mouse weight and tube weight were then measured daily throughout the experiment. Sipper bottles were rotated daily to minimize side preference. After 2–4 days of ethanol consumption, mice were euthanized as previously described.\n\nFor ethanol preference, results show 26 mice per group from 3 replicate experimental trials. For saccharin preference, 14–15 mice per group from 2 experimental trials are shown.\n\nPGE-m ELISA\n\nTrunk blood from mice was obtained after decapitation, collected in BD blood collection tubes (365967, Fisher). Tubes were then centrifuged in an Eppendorf table-top microcentrifuge at 10,000g for 10 minutes and serum was stored at −80°C. Serum was assayed with a Prostaglandin E Metabolite ELISA Kit (514531, Cayman) after removal of proteins by acetone precipitation. PGE-m ELISA was performed using the standard protocol, with derivatization, detailed in the product manual. Serum was diluted 15–25 times for the assay and OD was measured on a Biotek Epoch2 plate reader. A four parameter logistic curve was determined and raw PGE-m values were determined using the 4PL calculator by AAT Bioquest.\n\nBrain Dissection, RT-qPCR, and Primers\n\nMouse brains were dissected, flash frozen on aluminum foil chilled with dry ice and kept at −80°C. A brain matrix (ZIVIC Instruments, 5325) was allowed to chill on ice for 30 minutes. 2 mm sections of the brain from directly anterior of the cerebellum to the frontal pole were then cut using clean straight razor blades and the brain matrix. Sections were then observed to find landmarks indicating the location of the dorsal striatum as previously described. The dorsal striatum was dissected and RNA was extracted as previously described.\n\ncDNA was then synthesized using random hexamer primers and RT-qPCR was performed as previously described. Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S1.\n\nEthanol-Induced Conditioned Taste Aversion\n\nFollowing arrival, mice were acclimated to single-housing and sipper tubes by placing one sipper tube of water in their cages. Mice were weighed every other day to ensure they were consuming enough water to maintain their weight. The following protocol was adapted from a previous protocol that showed significant conditioned taste aversion in C57BL/6 mice. The first four days mice were acclimated to sipper tubes and single housing. Then, mice were subjected to 5 days of water restriction with only two hours of access to water for two hours daily (termed days 1–5 of the experiment). On day 5 of water restriction, mice were inoculated with C. albicans or PBS for mock-colonization and were re-inoculated every two days (days 5,7,9,11). On day 6, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and injected with sterile saline, 2g/kg of ethanol, or 3g/kg of ethanol (20% vol/vol) immediately after the end of the 1-hour period. Five hours later, mice were given access to water for 30 minutes to rehydrate. This process was repeated for days 8 and 10; on day 12, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and then euthanized. Fecal pellets were collected for CFU determination on days 6, 8, 10, and cecum contents were collected on day 12. Data were analyzed as a percentage of saline consumption compared to the initial amount consumed on day 6.\n\nOpen Field Activity Test\n\nOn the open field test (OFT) habituation day, mice were injected an average of 15 minutes before their respective trials with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally with an insulin syringe. Following 15 minutes, mice were gently placed in the center of a 37cm × 37cm plastic open field box. Mice were allowed to roam freely for 10 minutes and removed from the apparatus. The apparatus was then sterilized using 70% ethanol. This protocol was repeated for every mouse.\n\nOn OFT test day, mice were injected with 1.5g/kg of ethanol or sterile saline intraperitoneally an average of 15 minutes before their trials. The volume of injection varied from approximately 90–110uL depending on the weight of the mouse. The ethanol concentration was adjusted so that a mouse of average weight for the group would be injected with 100uL ethanol solution. The 10-minute test run and cleaning of the apparatus were repeated as above for every mouse. Mouse behavior was recorded using a web camera. Scoring videos was performed using EthovisionXT software to automatically determine distance traveled. Total distance traveled was plotted relative to the mean of the sterile saline group distance traveled.\n\nBalance Beam\n\nA balance beam apparatus was constructed using a square 0.25-inch diameter, 3-foot-long metal rod held approximately 1.5ft above the surface. A plastic box to hold bedding was affixed to one end to provide incentive for the mouse to cross the entirety of the balance beam. A reading lamp shining on the start zone of the beam was used as an aversive stimulus. Start and end points for the balance beam trials spanning 65 cm of the beam were marked.\n\nOn habituation day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally approximately 15 minutes before the start of their first of 3 trials. Mice were then placed in the start zone to begin trial 1. After completing the trial, mice were given 30 seconds of rest in their home cage before the start of trial 2. Trials 2 and 3 were performed by the same procedure. After a mouse completed 3 trials, the balance beam was cleaned using 70% ethanol and the next mouse was tested. In the event that a mouse would freeze, or very rarely fall, they would be gently prodded or placed back on the bar until they completed the trial. All mice within a cohort underwent this procedure.\n\nOn test day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline or injected with 1.5g/kg of ethanol as described in the open field activity test section. These injections were performed approximately 15 minutes before the start of the first trial. A web camera was used to record mouse behavior during these trials. The 3 trials were repeated as described above. All mice completed the entirety of the 3 trials.\n\nVideos were blinded for scoring. Start and stop times were determined when the mouse’s nose crossed designated marks on the bar. A slip was determined when a mouse’s foot slipped below the bar or a significant slip from a standing position on the bar to the pelvis touching the bar occurred. A fall was scored when the mouse slipped to the underside of the bar. Very rarely a mouse would fall from the bar into safety padding below the bar. Both of these events were scored equally as falls. Time or slips and falls were summed for all 3 trials for each mouse.\n\nLoss of Righting Reflex\n\nMice were co-housed with another mouse within the same group for the LORR. Their nestlet was removed for the test. Mice were injected with 3.5g/kg of ethanol intraperitoneally and the time of injection was recorded. Within roughly 1–2 minutes most mice lost righting reflex which was defined as an inability to right themselves when lying on their back in a V-shaped plastic trough. The time when a mouse lost righting reflex was designated the LORR onset. Six minutes after injection, mice were given one minute of exposure to isoflurane via the drop method and euthanized as above. Occasionally, a mouse would have to be removed from the data due to shearing of an artery during injection—significantly altering LORR time.\n\nBlood Ethanol Concentration Assay\n\nFollowing LORR, trunk blood was collected and serum was extracted as previously described in the PGE-m ELISA section. For the blood ethanol concentration determination, an EnzyChrom Ethanol Assay Kit (ECET-100, BioAssay Systems) was used. Standard protocols were followed for the determination using serum that was diluted 15X. OD was measured on a Biotek Epoch2 plate reader.",
  "results": "Results\n\nC. albicans colonization in female mice reduces ethanol consumption.\n\nMice were orally inoculated with C. albicans as described. We previously showed that inoculation did not result in significant changes in bacterial microbiota composition and did not evoke significant inflammation. Colonized and mock-colonized mice were subjected to a continuous access two-bottle choice experiment where mice were given access to two sipper tubes containing water or 15% ethanol simultaneously as described in Materials and Methods. Ethanol consumption and ethanol preference showed reductions on both days of the protocol in C. albicans-colonized mice compared to mock-colonized mice (mock) (Figures 1A, B). C. albicans-colonized mice consumed slightly less total liquid than mock on day 1 and the same amount of liquid on day 2. Both groups drank less total liquid than mice only given access to water (H2O-only) (Figure 1C). Colony forming units/gram of fecal pellets (FP) or cecum contents (CC) demonstrated the presence of C. albicans in the GI tract of inoculated mice throughout the experiment (Figure 1D). From these results, we concluded that C. albicans colonization reduced ethanol consumption in female mice.\n\nSaccharin preference was tested to determine whether C. albicans colonized mice showed alterations in preference to other rewarding substances. Saccharin preference was measured in a similar continuous access two-bottle choice experiment as described in Materials and Methods. Saccharin preference per day showed no effect of C. albicans colonization (Figure 1E). CFU/gram of FP or CC showed colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 1F). These results showed that C. albicans colonization did not exert broad effects on consumption of all rewarding substances. Rather, the effects were more selective.\n\nC. albicans-colonized mice have elevated serum PGE2 and PGE2 injection reduces murine ethanol preference.\n\nLevels of PGE2 were measured in serum obtained from C. albicans-colonized or mock-colonized mice following two days of ethanol consumption. Since PGE2 is not a stable molecule, concentrations of a metabolite of PGE2, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE2 (PGE-m), commonly utilized as a marker for PGE2, were assayed by ELISA. The assay showed that C. albicans-colonized mice had elevated serum PGE-m levels compared to H2O-only or mock groups (Figure 2A).\n\nTo test the effect of elevated PGE2 on ethanol consumption, a 4 day, two-bottle choice experiment was performed in which mice were injected with 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (dm-PGE2), a commonly-used, stable derivative of PGE2. Mice received either vehicle or one of four different concentrations of dm-PGE2 (25, 50, 100, 300 ug/kg) by subcutaneous injection each day. Lower concentrations (25 or 50 ug/kg) of dm-PGE2 led to low-level decreases in ethanol preference and consumption, and higher concentrations led to larger decreases compared to PBS-injected mice (Figures 2B, C). Thus, dm-PGE2 injection in mice decreased ethanol consumption in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the model that elevation of endogenous PGE2 results in decreased ethanol consumption.\n\nEP Receptor Antagonism Increases Ethanol Consumption and Preference to Mock-Colonized Levels.\n\nBased on these results, we hypothesized that PGE2 is a key driver of reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. To test this hypothesis, female mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans or mock-colonized with PBS and injected with 2 g/kg each of an EP1 antagonist (SC-51089, Cayman Chemical) and an EP2 antagonist (TG6–10-1, Cayman Chemical) subcutaneously each day of the 2 day two-bottle choice experiment. Mock-colonized mice injected with vehicle or antagonist showed no difference in ethanol consumption or preference (Figure 3A,B). Mice that were colonized with C. albicans and injected with vehicle showed significantly lower ethanol consumption and preference compared to other groups. Those injected with antagonists showed significantly higher ethanol consumption and preference on day 1 and a trend towards an increase in ethanol consumption on day 2. Some reductions in total liquid consumed in C. albicans-colonized, vehicle-injected mice were observed (Figure 3C). Mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 3D).\n\nWe also tested whether male mice had a reduction in ethanol consumption following C. albicans colonization and whether this phenotype could be reversed by EP antagonists. A trend towards reduction in ethanol consumption by the vehicle injected, C. albicans-colonized mice was observed on day 2 of ethanol consumption, and total liquid-consumed was also reduced (Figures 3E,F,G). These mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 3H). These results support the model that activation of EP1/EP2 receptors in C. albicans-colonized mice decreases their ethanol consumption and preference. Further experiments were conducted with females only since females showed strong effects of colonization.\n\nIncreased Serum PGE2 in C. albicans-colonized Mice Correlates with Gene Expression in the Brain.\n\nWe next tested the hypothesis that C. albicans gut colonization and elevation of PGE2 concentration would result in transcriptomic changes in the brain. PGE2 binds to its cognate receptors encoded by four different genes, Ep1, Ep2, Ep3, and Ep4. PGE2 has been shown to upregulate expression of Ep receptor genes in a dose dependent manner in neuronal cell lines and various tissues in the body. We decided to focus on a region of the brain involved in habit formation, the dorsal striatum (DS), as well as other addiction-implicated regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc).\n\nTo test the hypothesis, RT-qPCR from DS-cDNA was performed and expression of Ep1 and Ep2 relative mock-colonized from the same experimental trial was measured. There were no significant differences in Ep receptor expression between groups in the DS, PFC, or NAc (Figure S1). However, correlations between PGE-m concentration in the serum and relative expression of Ep1 or Ep2 in the same C. albicans-colonized mouse were observed. Gene expression relative to the average for mock-colonized was plotted against the concentration of PGE-m (also standardized to mock-colonized). Figure 4A,B demonstrates that mice with higher concentrations of serum PGE2 exhibited higher expression of Ep1 and Ep2. In mock-colonized mice, there were no significant correlations (Figure 4C,D). We observed similar significant correlations of Ep1 expression and PGE-m concentration in the PFC and NAc (Figure S2). Elevated PGE2 levels were thus associated with higher expression of Ep receptors in multiple regions of the brain.\n\nWe also analyzed the expression of dopamine receptors in the DS of these mice. The dopamine system in the DS is commonly involved with learning and habit formation. Expression of two main classes of dopamine receptors, Drd1 and Drd2, was measured. A trend towards a reduction in Drd1 expression and a statistically significant reduction in Drd2 expression in C. albicans-colonized mice compared to mock-colonized were observed (Figure 5A). Additionally, mice injected with low-dose dm-PGE2 (25 or 50ug/kg injections) showed reduced expression of Drd1 and Drd2 (Figure 5B). Interestingly, Drds showed no differences in expression in the PFC or NAc (Figure S3). Furthermore, other addiction-related genes showed no significant differences in expression in the DS (Figure S4). These results show that both C. albicans colonization and low-dose dm-PGE2 injections reduce dopamine receptor expression in the DS.\n\nExpression of Drd1 or Drd2 in mock or C. albicans-colonized mice correlated with total ethanol consumed. In the dorsal striatum, DRD1 is involved with reward formation and DRD2 is involved with aversion formation. Plots of Drd expression and total ethanol consumed showed a significant positive correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumption in mock-colonized mice (Figure 6A) and a trend towards a positive correlation between Drd2 and total ethanol consumed (Figure 6C). In C. albicans-colonized mice, by contrast, a significant negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol consumption was observed (figure 6D). No correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumed was observed in these mice (Figure 6B). Thus, C. albicans-colonized mice that consumed lower amounts of ethanol exhibited higher expression of the aversion-associated DRD2 receptor.\n\nCandida albicans colonization accelerates the onset of conditioned taste aversion in mice.\n\nBased on the low ethanol consumption and negative correlation between Drd2 expression and ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice, we hypothesized that these mice would show enhanced ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Ethanol-induced CTA is based on the principle that mice will develop an aversion to a novel tasting solution when it is paired with an ethanol injection. Mice were tested for ethanol-induced CTA as described in Materials and Methods.\n\nThe first exposure to the tastant showed the baseline consumption level, prior to injection (conditioning) with ethanol or control (sterile saline). Trials 2–4 showed consumption after conditioning, expressed as the change from initial consumption (Figure 7A). In trial 2, control mice showed similar or higher than baseline consumption of the tastant. Both mock-colonized and C. albicans-colonized mice injected with 3g/kg ethanol developed a near complete aversion to the tastant (100% reduction), which continued through trials 3 and 4. In contrast, mice given a lower concentration of ethanol (2g/kg) showed differences between groups. There was no significant aversion in the mock-colonized mice in trial 2 of this injection group and C. albicans-colonized mice showed a significant reduction in saline consumption compared to control mice in trial 2. On trial 3, both mock-colonized and C. albicans-colonized mice injected with 2g/kg ethanol showed significant aversion to the tastant. There were no differences in colonization or mouse weight throughout the experiment (Figure 7B, S5). C. albicans-colonized mice thus developed ethanol-induced CTA more rapidly.\n\nC. albicans-colonized mice are more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol and motor coordination deficits can be restored by EP receptor antagonism.\n\nThe more rapid development of ethanol-induced CTA in C. albicans-colonized mice suggests these mice could be more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol as correlations between these phenotypes have been observed. Therefore, we tested whether C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol sedation, ethanol-induced motor coordination defects, and depressant effects of ethanol (Figure 8A).\n\nThe first experiment was the open field activity test (OFT), which measures how susceptible C57BL/6 mice are to the depressant effects of alcohol based on the decrease in distance traveled in the OFT following ethanol injection (1.5 g/kg). Mice were injected with ethanol (dose) or control (sterile saline [SS]) and distance traveled in 10 minutes in the OFT was measured. Results are expressed relative to the SS-injected mice within each experimental trial (mock or C. albicans-colonized) (Figure 8B). Results showed a significant reduction in distance traveled by C. albicans-colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to C. albicans-colonized, SS-injected mice. There was not a significant reduction in distance traveled by the mock-colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to SS-injected mice. These results show that the C. albicans-colonized mice were more strongly affected by ethanol.\n\nThe loss of righting reflex (LORR) experiment tested the ability of mice to right themselves after injection with a sedative amount of ethanol (3.5 g/kg). The time for the mice to lose their righting reflex after the injection is termed LORR onset. Mock or C. albicans-colonized mice that had received SS injections the previous three days, or mock mice that received ethanol the previous 3 days had no differences in LORR onset (Figure 8C). C. albicans-colonized mice that received ethanol injections on the previous 3 days showed a significantly shorter LORR onset compared to all groups. Blood ethanol concentration from serum collected at the time of loss of righting reflex showed a trend towards higher levels in these mice (Figure 8D). These results indicate a synergistic effect of ethanol treatment (including prior treatment) and C. albicans-colonization that increased the sedative effects of ethanol.\n\nMotor coordination defects were tested using performance on the balance beam, which can measure coordination based on the number of slips and falls on the beam. Mice were injected with SS or ethanol and their performance was assessed. The total number of slips or falls throughout three trials (Figure 8E) and the total amount of time required to complete three trials were measured (figure 8F). Mock-colonized or C. albicans-colonized mice injected with SS did not slip/fall often and completed the trials quickly. Mock-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed a significant increase in slips and falls, consistent with ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits. C. albicans-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed significantly more slips and falls than any of the other groups and were significantly slower. Furthermore, there were no differences in colonization or mouse weight in these experiments (Figure S6). Thus, C. albicans-colonized mice showed more ethanol-induced impairment in motor coordination.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that PGE2 signaling contributed to the differences in mouse susceptibility to the effects of ethanol, mice were injected with the combination of EP1 and EP2 antagonists (2mg/kg each) before each behavioral test. Total slips and falls on the balance beam test following these injections was measured. C. albicans-colonized mice injected with ethanol and antagonists showed a significant decrease in slips and falls compared to the ethanol and vehicle group (Figure 8G). There was no difference between the C. albicans-colonized group with ethanol and antagonists compared to either of the mock + ethanol injected groups. We did not see a similar reversal of phenotypes by antagonists in either the OFT or LORR (Figure S7). These results showed that blocking PGE2 signaling in C. albicans-colonized mice reduced their susceptibility to ethanol-induced impairment of motor control.\n\nTaken together, the results showed that C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to the depressant and sedative effects of ethanol, and to ethanol-induced impairment in motor control. PGE2 effects on EP1 and EP2 receptors make a major contribution to the mechanism of ethanol-induced motor impairment.",
