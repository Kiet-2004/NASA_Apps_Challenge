  "title": "Fifteen Days Microgravity Causes Growth in Calvaria of Mice",
  "abstract": "Bone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group – the mean ± SD for SF group was 10.48 ± 0.47 %, compared to 9.64 ± 0.79 % for GC group (p<0.05). CsTh demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ±0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ±0.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ±0.029 g/cc for GC and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cc for SF (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading by tissue.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nSkeletal adaptation to microgravity is a physiological obstacle that may limit prolonged space exploration. Studies from astronauts demonstrate variable bone loss corresponding to mission length. Weight-bearing bones such as the femur, calcaneus, hip, spine and neck lose more bone than non-weight-bearing bones, establishing the pivotal role of skeletal unloading on bone remodeling. Physiological studies of the Skylab missions document increasing calcium and phosphate levels in both serum and urine of crewmembers, reflecting a gradual loss of bone mineral content in these astronauts. Some of these crewmembers continue to lose bone after returning to Earth, and those who experience the greatest bone decrements do not fully recover even after five years. The correlation between bone loss and diminishing bone strength suggests a significant risk of fractures for astronauts.\n\nDevelopment of countermeasures against the osteopenic effect of space travel requires a better understanding of bone adaptation. Human bed-rest is a method used to simulate microgravity without spaceflight. Using this technique, LeBlanc and team demonstrate the greatest bone loss in weight-bearing bones of the lower body, notably the lumbar spine, femur, tibia and the calcaneus. A 60-day bed-rest study reports the greatest loss at the proximal femur and distal tibia. These results are consistent with bone changes induced by spaceflight. Bone measurements on Skylab astronauts show increasing mineral loss in the os calcis corresponding to the length of the mission. A more comprehensive comparison between 18 cosmonauts and bed-rest subjects supports that spaceflight produces similar, if not greater, mineral loss in weight-bearing bones than bed-rest. Bones of the upper limbs are minimally impacted, and increases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the skull are observed.\n\nTo date, musculoskeletal research on physiological adaptations to microgravity focuses on weight-bearing regions of the lower body. While modest effort is made to study remodeling of partially-loaded bones (ie: the upper appendages) in response to weightlessness, data on non-loaded bones are scarce and are generated mostly from bed-rest and rodent hind-limb unloading studies. Studies of extended bed-rest and lower-body disuse demonstrate patterns of increased BMD in skull bones along with mineral loss in bones of the lower axial and appendicular skeleton. In their simulated weightlessness experiment, Roer and Dillaman found heavier dry and ash weights of the skulls from hindlimb-suspended rats. However, it is unclear whether the observed adaptations of unloaded bones to inactivity and simulated microgravity reflect the remodeling of these bones in actual microgravity.\n\nThe present paper attempts to quantify the adaptations of cranial bones to spaceflight. Specifically, our goals are to evaluate the remodeling of skull bones due to actual microgravity, to compare the adaptation of non-loaded bones to actual microgravity versus simulated microgravity as reported in literature, and to quantify these changes based on mineral content and bone volume. We hypothesize that microgravity induces adaptive growth in bones that normally do not bear weight, possibly from headward fluid shifts that accompany actual microgravity.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nControl and Spaceflight Groups\n\nExperimental protocols conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and were approved by the Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Prior to experiments, all animals were deemed healthy by the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) veterinarians.\n\nSeven 23-week-old adult, female, wild-type C57BL/C mice representing the spaceflight group (n=7) experienced fifteen days of gravity aboard the 15-day NASA shuttle mission STS-131. Eight female wild-type C57-BL/C mice, littermates of the spaceflight group, were maintained on land under normal gravitational loads and represent the control group (n=8). Both groups were maintained on a 12:12-hour light-dark cycle and provided with pre-adapted food and water ad libitum, from April 4 to 20, 2010 for the flight mice and from April 6 to 22, 2010 for the ground controls. Both groups were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules with gravity or lack thereof being the primary environmental difference. All mice were weighed twice – once just prior to cage-loading, and again after cage-unloading at the termination of the 15-day period and prior to sacrifice, and the weight change of each animal was determined.\n\nAfter mission completion, the spaceflight mice were received and euthanized at the NASA Kennedy Space Center, and their tissues were harvested within three to four hours of shuttle landing. The ground control mice were identically housed for the duration of the STS-131 mission beginning 48 hours after launch, and were euthanized at the termination of their experimental duration 48 hours after shuttle landing. All animals were handled and dissected by members of the Biospecimen Sharing Project at NASA-KSC. The calvariae were preserved in liquid nitrogen and shipped to our laboratory at University of California, San Diego for analysis.\n\nIt should be noted that the STS-131 mission originally carried eleven adult, female, wild-type C57BL/C mice. However, only seven were included in the current study. Three of the eleven mice were euthanized one day after landing instead of within four hours. The same number of days also held true for three of the eleven ground control mice, which we excluded. Additionally, one calvaria from the spaceflight group suffered multiple bone fractures from inappropriate handling and storage, and was deemed unsuitable for analysis.\n\nMicro-Computed Tomography Assessment of Mice Calvariae\n\nSamples were thawed and imaged on a micro-Computed Tomography scanner, Skyscan 1076 (Kontich, Belgium). Calvariae were wrapped in tissue paper moistened with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and scanned at 9μm voxel size, applying an electrical potential of 50 kVp and current of 200uA, and using a 0.5mm aluminum filter. Tissue Mineral Density (TMD) was determined by calibration of images against 2mm diameter hydroxyapatite (HA) rods (250 and 750 mg/cm3) with a beam hardening correction algorithm applied during image reconstruction.\n\nBone structure and histomorphometric parameters were visualized and determined using Skyscan software, Dataviewer, CTAn (Kontich, Belgium). A volume of interest (VOI, defined by a standardized rectangular volume measuring 18mm3, 5.5mm × 1.2mm area in the coronal plane, 2.7mm depth) was located at the center of the parietal bones (Fig. 1, panels A, G and H) by identifying the intersection of the anterior lambdoid and coronal sutures with the sagittal suture to position the center of the VOI on the sagittal plane and localizing the VOI center on the coronal plane at the sagittal suture. After applying a global threshold, an erosion of one pixel was performed to eliminate partial volume effects. The following parameters were then calculated: total volume (TV, defined as the VOI), bone volume (BV, defined as the volume within the VOI occupied by bone), bone volume fraction (BV/TV, defined as the proportion of the VOI occupied by bone, expressed as a percentage), cross-sectional bone thickness (Cs.Th, measured as the thickness of the calvaria from the edge of cortical bone underlying the scalp to overlying the meninges, calculated in 2D on the basis of the plate model), and tissue mineral density (TMD, determined by calibration of the attenuation values to those obtained from the HA rods).\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAll computations were performed with SPSS. The effect of spaceflight relative to ground control was assessed by unpaired two-tailed t-tests for the parameters of weight change, BV/TV, Cs.Th and TMD, respectively. Significance was set at p < 0.05.",
  "results": "Results\n\nMice from both the ground control and spaceflight groups were judged to be healthy by a veterinarian at NASA Kennedy Space Center. During the first two days, mice from the spaceflight group decreased their food intake, possibly attributed to shuttle takeoff and the initial experience of microgravity. Their appetite returned to normal after the two-day adjustment period. The ground control mice did not demonstrate any changes in food consumption during the experimental period. In the ground control group, each mouse lost on average 1.51 grams of weight from an average of 26.16 grams pre cage-loading to 24.65 grams at cage-unloading, with an SD of 1.49. Each mouse from the spaceflight group lost on average 2.82 grams of weight from 26.20 grams before spaceflight to 23.38 grams upon mission completion, with an SD of 0.95. None of the mice in either group gained weight. The difference in weight changes between these two groups showed a trend of more aggressive weight loss in the spaceflight group compared to the ground control group (p=0.07). Previous studies of weight changes in astronauts attribute most of the reduction to fluid loss (60%), with fat utilization (30%) and muscle catabolism (10%) accounting for the remainder.\n\nComparing murine calvariae, BV/TV was increased (p<0.05) from a mean of 9.64 ±0.79% (Mean ± SD) in the ground control group to 10.48 ±0.47% in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4A). Correspondingly, Cs.Th showed a trend of an increase (p=0.12) from a mean of 0.099 ±0.006mm in the ground control group to 0.104 ±0.005mm in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4B). There was no apparent effect on TMD (p=0.31), with a mean of 0.878 ±0.029g/cc in the ground control group and 0.893 ± 0.028g/cc in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4C).\n\nOf the three parameters used to determine bone growth, calvaria BV/TV from the spaceflight group exhibited a statistically significant increase of 8.7% (10.48/9.64 – 1) over the ground control group. Cs.Th indicated a trend of increase at 5.1% (0.104/0.099 – 1). Increase in TMD between the two groups was much less at 1.8% (0.893/0.878 – 1). Comparison between the groups shows that in addition to increased average thickness of the calvaria in microgravity, there was also some bone expansion into sinuses within the parietal bones (Fig. 2).\n\nDespite the more aggressive weight-reduction experienced by the spaceflight group (10.76%) compared their ground control littermates (5.77%), the calvariae from the spaceflight group demonstrated volume expansion, which contradicts the observed changes in the bodyweights between the two groups.",
