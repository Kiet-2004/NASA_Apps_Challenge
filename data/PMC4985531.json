  "title": "Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy Reduces Bone Marrow Adiposity in ob/ob Mice Fed Regular and High-Fat Diets",
  "abstract": "Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight- to 10-week-old male ob/ob mice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 107 particles) and maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets; ob/ob mice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not necessarily result in increased bone mass.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nAdipose tissue in bone marrow may contribute to metabolic health through its effects on local energy balance and/or its actions as an endocrine organ. Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Bone marrow contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) capable of differentiating into cells of the osteoblastic and adipocytic lineages. A reciprocal relationship between the number of mature osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes may occur as a consequence of differentiation of MSCs toward one lineage at the expense of the other lineage. Mechanistically, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a transcription factor that plays a key role in regulation of adipogenesis and lipid uptake, has been implicated as a factor controlling MSC differentiation. Inhibition of PPARγ increases osteoblast differentiation while decreasing adipocyte differentiation. Osteoblast-targeted overexpression of PPARγ inhibits bone mass gain in male mice and increases ovariectomy-induced osteopenia in female mice. Furthermore, cultured adipocytes release factors capable of inducing osteoblast linage cells to differentiate into an adipocyte-like phenotype. Thus, excessive marrow adipose tissue (MAT) has the potential to directly and/or indirectly reduce bone mass by inhibiting osteoblast differentiation. As such, an increase in MAT may contribute to osteoporosis in conditions, such as menopause, skeletal disuse, alcohol abuse, and eating disorders.\n\nInterestingly, anorexia and obesity both result in increased MAT. Anorexia is commonly associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. By contrast, being overweight is generally associated with increased BMD and reduced fracture risk. However, recent studies suggest that morbid obesity has negative effects on bone quality. Thus, it is possible that the increase in MAT plays a role in the detrimental skeletal changes associated with both extremes in body weight.\n\nLeptin, an adipokine produced in proportion to fat mass, plays a critical role in central nervous system-mediated regulation of energy homeostasis. Additionally, leptin plays an important positive role in skeletal growth and maturation. Indeed, leptin signaling deficiency results in abnormal growth plate development and mild osteopetrosis.\n\nLeptin suppresses PPARγ expression and increases lipolysis in adipose tissue in rodents. In parallel, leptin increases longitudinal bone growth, osteoblastogenesis and bone formation. Thus, the low leptin levels resulting from insufficient adipose tissue observed in anorexia may contribute to increased MAT and decreased bone formation. In contrast to anorexia, obesity typically results in increased leptin levels which, in turn, should suppress MAT. Many authors have concluded that leptin resistance plays an important role in hyperphagia and weight gain associated with obesity. Thus, leptin resistance may counteract the expected response to elevated leptin levels and thereby contribute to an increase in MAT during obesity. However, some new studies question whether resistance to endogenous leptin contributes to development of diet-induced obesity in mice. If leptin resistance is a major contributor to the etiology of obesity, it may be overcome in normal rodents, at least in part, by increasing hypothalamic leptin levels. Whatever its precise role in diet-induced obesity, it is clear that leptin resistance resulting from loss of function of the leptin receptor (db/db mice), in addition to inducing morbid obesity, results in profound negative effects on the skeleton. Furthermore, some of these negative skeletal effects (e.g., reduced bone formation) are recapitulated, without impacting energy metabolism, following adoptive transfer of bone marrow from db/db mice into wild-type (WT) mice.\n\nLeptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice exhibit excessive MAT in long bones. Short-term delivery of leptin into the hypothalamus was shown to reduce peripheral fat depots as well as MAT. However, the long-term effects of increased leptin levels on MAT have not been well characterized. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy has been shown to result in life-long reductions in body weight in ob/ob mice. The goal of the present study was to determine the long-duration effects of increased hypothalamic leptin, using recombinant adeno-associated virus leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep), on bone marrow adiposity in morbidly obese ob/ob mice. Given that the energy density of a diet impacts weight gain and MAT levels, the effects of a regular and high energy density (high fat) diet were also evaluated.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nExperimental Animals\n\nEight- to 10-week-old male WT C57BL/6J (B6) and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice on the same genetic background were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). This age corresponds to peak cancellous bone volume fraction in the femur metaphysis. The mice were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida. The mice were housed individually in a temperature (21–23°C) and light-controlled room (lights on 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) under specific pathogen-free conditions.\n\nExperiment 1: Effects of 30 Weeks of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy on Marrow Adiposity and Cancellous Bone Histomorphometry in ob/ob Mice\n\nFollowing arrival, ob/ob mice were randomized by weight into four treatment groups: (1) untreated (n = 6), (2) control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP, n = 7), (3) rAAV-Lep (n = 8), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep (n = 6). The mice were maintained on standard mouse chow (LM-485, Teklad, Madison, WI, USA) and sacrificed 30 weeks following vector administration at 38–40 weeks of age. This age corresponds to a period immediately prior to a drastic increase in mortality in ob/ob mice – median lifespan in ob/ob mice is 55 weeks compared to 131 weeks in WT mice. The effects of treatment on hypothalamic leptin gene expression, body weight, food intake, hormone levels, organ weights, and cancellous and cortical bone architecture evaluated by microcomputed tomography in this study are detailed elsewhere.\n\nExperiment 2: Effects of 15 Weeks of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy and 8 Weeks of High-Fat Diet on Marrow Adiposity and Cancellous Bone Histomorphometry in ob/ob Mice\n\nExperiment 2 was conducted using WT and ob/ob mice. Following arrival, WT mice (n = 12) were maintained on regular chow (LM-485, Teklad, Madison, WI, USA; caloric density 3.4 kcal/g, 11% of kcal from fat) until 15–17 weeks of age and then randomized by weight into two groups: (1) control (n = 3) or (2) high-fat diet (n = 9). Mice in the control group continued to consume the regular diet ad libitum while mice in the high-fat group were placed on a high-fat diet (caloric density 4.7 kcal/g; 45% of kcal from fat, primarily from lard; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) fed ad libitum. The mice were sacrificed 8 weeks later at 23–25 weeks of age – an age corresponding to cessation of linear growth in B6 mice.\n\nIn conjunction, ob/ob mice were randomized by weight into two treatment groups: rAAV-Lep (n = 16) or control vector rAAV-GFP (n = 14). At 7 weeks post-vector administration, rAAV-GFP and rAAV-Lep mice were each divided into two groups: one group continued to consume regular diet and the other was switched to a high-fat diet as described above for WT mice. The mice were sacrificed 8 weeks later at 23–25 weeks of age (15 weeks following vector administration). The effect of the rAAV-Lep pretreatment and high-fat diet on hypothalamic leptin gene expression, body weight, food intake, organ weights, hormone levels, and cancellous and cortical bone architecture determined by microcomputed tomography are detailed elsewhere.\n\nConstruction and Packaging of rAAV Vectors\n\nrAAV-leptin gene therapy and rAAV-GFP vectors were constructed and packaged as previously described. In brief, the vector pTR-CBA-Ob EcoRI fragment of pCR-rOb containing rat leptin cDNA was subcloned into rAAV vector plasmid pAAVβGEnh after deleting the EcoRI fragment carrying the β-glucoronidase cDNA sequence. The control vector, rAAV-GFP, was similarly constructed to encode the GFP gene.\n\nVector Administration\n\nFor vector administration, the mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.), placed on a Kopf stereotaxic apparatus with mouse adapter for intracerebroventricular injection, and injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-Lep (9 × 107 particles in 1.5 μl) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 107 particles in 1.5 μl). The coordinates employed for microinjector placement in the third cerebroventricle were 0.3 mm posterior to bregma, 0.0 lateral to midline, and 4.2 mm below the dura.\n\nTissue Collection and Analyses\n\nAt the end of each experiment mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg; i.p.) and euthanized by exsanguination. Femora were excised, cleaned of soft tissue, and stored in 70% ethanol. Femora were prepared for histomorphometric evaluation as described. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene and embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Frontal sections (4 μm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2165) and affixed to slides precoated with a 1% gelatin solution. One section/animal was stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for assessment of bone and cell-based measurements.\n\nHistomorphometric data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate and 0.1 mm from cortical bone. Cancellous bone measurements included bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, %) and the derived architectural indices of trabecular number (mm−1), trabecular thickness (micrometer), and trabecular separation (micrometer). Measurements of MAT included overall marrow adiposity (adipose area/tissue area, %), adipocyte density (mm−2), and adipocyte size (micrometers2). Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane and lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. This method has been validated by fat extraction and analysis. Osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters were also measured and expressed as % of total bone perimeter. Osteoblasts were identified as plump cuboidal cells immediately adjacent to a thin layer of osteoid in direct contact with the bone perimeter. Osteoclasts were identified as multinucleated (two or more nuclei) cells with acid phosphatase positive (red-stained) cytoplasm in contact with the bone perimeter. Data are reported using standard two-dimensional nomenclature.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nMean responses for Experiment 1 were compared among the untreated, rAAV-GFP, rAAV-Lep, and pair-fed groups using one-way analysis of variance. For Experiment 2, the effects of treatment and diet were assessed using two-way analysis of variance. Pairwise comparisons were made using t-tests or the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test. The required conditions for valid use of linear models were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and the Anderson–Darling test of normality. The Benjamini and Hochberg method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Data analysis was performed using R version 3.3.2.",
  "results": "Results\n\nExperiment 1: Effects of 30 Weeks of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy on Marrow Adiposity and Cancellous Bone Histomorphometry in ob/ob Mice\n\nThe effects of treatment on body weight and on cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table 1. rAAV-Lep treatment resulted in lower body weight compared to untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice. Significant differences in cancellous bone area fraction, trabecular number, or trabecular spacing were not detected with treatment. However, trabecular thickness was lower in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated mice, but did not differ from pair-fed ob/ob mice.\n\nThe effects of treatment on MAT in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Figure 1. Marrow adiposity (adipose area/tissue area) (Figure 1A), adipocyte density (Figure 1B), and adipocyte size (Figure 1C) were lower in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice. Significant differences among untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice were not detected for any of the MAT measurements. The effects of rAAV-Lep treatment on marrow adiposity can be readily appreciated in Figures 1D–G.\n\nThe effects of treatment on osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Figure 2. Osteoblast perimeter (Figure 2A) and osteoclast perimeter (Figure 2B) were higher in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice. Significant differences among untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice were not detected for either of the cellular endpoints evaluated. The effects of rAAV-Lep treatment on osteoblast and osteoclast perimeter can be appreciated in Figures 2C–F.\n\nExperiment 2: Effects of 15 Weeks of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy and 8 Weeks of High-Fat Diet on Marrow Adiposity and Cancellous Bone Histomorphometry in ob/ob Mice\n\nThe effects of rAAV-Lep pretreatment and high-fat diet on body weight and on cancellous bone in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table 2. Body weight was higher in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to WT mice fed regular diet. Body weight was also higher in ob/ob mice fed high fat compared to ob/ob mice fed regular diet and rAAV-Lep treatment resulted in lower body weight. Cancellous bone area fraction, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number were higher and trabecular spacing was lower in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to WT mice fed regular diet. rAAV-Lep treatment in ob/ob mice resulted in lower cancellous bone area fraction and trabecular thickness. Significant differences in trabecular number or trabecular spacing were not detected with treatment in the ob/ob mice. With the exception of trabecular thickness, which was lower, significant differences between WT mice and rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice fed regular diets were not detected for any of the remaining cancellous endpoints evaluated.\n\nThe effects of treatment on marrow adiposity in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Figure 3. Marrow adiposity and adipocyte size were higher in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to mice fed regular diet. Significant differences in adipocyte density were not detected with diet in WT mice. rAAV-Lep treatment in ob/ob mice resulted in lower marrow adiposity due to lower adipocyte density as well as lower adipocyte size. Significant differences in marrow adiposity, adipocyte density, or adipocyte size were not detected between WT and rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice fed regular diet.",
