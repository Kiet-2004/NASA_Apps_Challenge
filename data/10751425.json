  "title": "Bisphosphonates attenuate age‐related muscle decline in  Caenorhabditis elegans",
  "abstract": "Abstract\n\nBackground\n\nAge‐related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an anti‐sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.\n\nMethods\n\nUsing  Caenorhabditis elegans  as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP‐tagged myofibres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 post‐adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA‐mediated healthspan extension were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the life‐course.\n\nResults\n\nWe found 100 nM and 1 μM ZA increased lifespan (P < 0.001) and healthspan [954 ± 53 (100 nM) and 963 ± 48 (1 μM) vs. 834 ± 59% (untreated) population activity AUC, P < 0.05]. 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (P < 0.0001) but not healthspan (758.9 ± 37 vs. 834 ± 59, P > 0.05), whereas 100 and 500 μM ZA were larval lethal. ZA (1 μM) significantly improved myofibrillar structure on days 4 and 6 post‐adulthood (83 and 71% well‐organized myofibres, respectively, vs. 56 and 34% controls, P < 0.0001) and increased well‐networked mitochondria at day 6 (47 vs. 16% in controls, P < 0.01). Genes required for ZA‐mediated healthspan extension included fdps‐1/FDPS‐1 (278 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively, P < 0.0001), daf‐16/FOXO (680 ± 16 vs. 894 ± 17%, P < 0.01) and agxt‐2/BAIBA (531 ± 23 vs. 552 ± 8%, P > 0.05). Life/healthspan was extended through knockdown of igdb‐1/FNDC5 (635 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in gene knockdown vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01) and sir‐2.3/SIRT‐4 (586 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05), with no synergistic improvements in ZA co‐treatment vs. knockdown alone [651 ± 12 vs. 635 ± 10% (igdb‐1/FNDC5) and 583 ± 9 vs. 586 ± 10% (sir‐2.3/SIRT‐4), both P > 0.05]. Conversely, let‐756/FGF21 and sir‐2.2/SIRT‐4 were dispensable for ZA‐induced healthspan [630 ± 6 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01 (let‐756/FGF21) and 568 ± 9 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05 (sir‐2.2/SIRT‐4)].\n\nConclusions\n\nDespite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays  Caenorhabditis elegans  sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable anti‐sarcopenia therapy.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nAge‐related muscle decline, termed ‘sarcopenia’, is classified as a specific disease associated with numerous health risk factors in the elderly, prevalent in at least 10% of older populations and up to 31% as a co‐morbidity. Despite associated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions and significant impacts on individual quality of life and all‐cause mortality, efficacious treatment strategies against sarcopenia remain limited.\n\nPhysical activity plus targeted nutrition represents the most effective chronic modifiable lifestyle strategy against sarcopenia. However, ageing muscle growth responses to these interventions are sub‐optimal, and certain older individuals can be unable (i.e., through injury and/or access to exercise facilities) or unwilling to participate in regular vigorous activity. Indeed, ~50–70% of those aged 75+ years are physically inactive, meaning complementary pharmaceutical therapies are relevant to a significant portion of the ageing population. Established drugs that modify human muscle ageing are limited, and importantly, many of these drugs display variable therapeutic efficacy and associate with harmful side‐effect profiles that render them inappropriate for long‐term clinical use. For example, rapamycin holds variable efficacy against sarcopenia indices across health and disease but is a potent immunosuppressant unsuitable for chronic use in otherwise healthy humans. Drug identification efforts might instead focus on repurposing existing clinically approved compounds for sarcopenic indications as a realistic, immediately employable approach to therapeutic discovery.\n\nBisphosphonates are chemically stable derivatives of endogenous inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of multiple biosynthetic reactions and present in most tissues, including muscle. Recapitulating the effects of inorganic pyrophosphate, bisphosphonates inhibit calcification and lower hydroxyapatite degradation, while also promoting osteoclast apoptosis to effectively protect against bone loss. As such, bisphosphonates have become a standard clinical strategy against osteoporosis and a variety of skeletal conditions. Yet skeletal muscle health and bone function are inextricably linked: Effective mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle‐bone communication is essential to muscle and bone health, with sarcopenia and osteoporosis often presenting together. Osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or pamidronate (the most popular first‐line bisphosphonates) for between 6 months and 3 years display significant increases in muscle strength and total muscle mass. Recent reports on the most potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (ZA), show improved muscle morphology, strength and mass in rodent models of cancer cachexia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and denervation‐induced muscle atrophy. Retrospective analysis of osteoporosis patients prescribed ZA for 3 years also exhibit significant increases in total lean muscle mass, compared with a loss of muscle mass in untreated controls. In the ageing context, ZA‐treated fruit flies displayed increased survival and improved climbing ability across the life course, suggesting improved neuromuscular ageing. However, the direct anti‐sarcopenic efficacy of ZA has not been established.\n\nThe nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans  is an established model of ageing, displaying ordered, progressive age‐related deterioration of multiple tissues, including muscle.  C. elegans  muscle is also highly morphologically and metabolically similar to human muscle and has high genetic orthology (60–85%) of sub‐muscular systems with people. As with fruit flies,  C. elegans  are invertebrates that do not possess clear orthologues of mammalian bone secretory factors (‘osteokines’).  C. elegans  are, therefore, an excellent system for understanding muscle‐specific mechanisms of bisphosphonates, independently of bone‐derived confounders. We thus employed  C. elegans  as a genomic model of ageing muscle decline to establish the bone‐independent effects, and mechanisms of, bisphosphonates on sarcopenia progression as part of an ageing drug translational pipeline with realistic, near‐term applicability in the clinic.",
  "methods": "Methods\n\nAssessing zoledronic acid effects on  Caenorhabditis elegans  lifespan and healthspan\n\nWild‐type (N2 stain) animals were age synchronized by gravity flotation and ~80 L1 larvae were placed on 33 mm petri dishes (20 L1 per 33 mm plate) containing 2 mL NGM agar [50 mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) bacteriological peptone, 1.7% (w/v) agar, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6), 12.9 μM cholesterol] and seeded with 200 μL of OP50  Escherichia coli  bacteria. For ZA treatments, 100 μL of dilute compound (i.e. – 100 μL of 2.3 μM, 23 μM, 230 μM, 2.3 mM and 11.5 μM intermediate dilutions in ddH2O for 100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM and 500 μM concentrations, respectively) were diluted into a 2.3 mL plate volume to achieve the desired final concentration. Control animals were grown on plates seeded with 100 μL of ddH2O to account for any diluting of bacterial lawns. Animals were grown on petri dishes for ~48 h at 20°C to reach young adulthood, then washed off using 3 mL M9 buffer (3 g KH2PO4, 6 g Na2HPO4, 5 g NaCl, 1 mL 1 M MgSO4 per litre) and pooled into 60 cm petri dishes. From these pooled samples, ~70 young adults were collected and loaded into microfluidic chips (Infinity chips; Nemalife Inc., TX) using a 2.5 mL syringe, where the animals remained throughout the rest of the life course. Using the Infinity screening system (Nemalife Inc., TX), on every day of the life course, chips were washed for 90 s with liquid NGM to remove progeny followed by a further 90 s recording for subsequent computational analysis of animal survival and locomotion. Chips were then injected with ~200 μL of 20 mg/mL OP50 supplemented with ZA or ddH2O. Specifically, 980 μL of 20 mg/mL OP50 was supplemented with 20 μL of the required ZA intermediate dilution (i.e., 5 μM, 50 μM and 500 μM intermediates for 100 nM, 1 μM and 10 μM of ZA, respectively) or 20 μL of ddH2O for controls. Chips were then stored in petri dishes at 20°C for the next 24 h with a damp, sterile tissue and parafilmed to avoid the microfluidic arena drying out.\n\nLifespan was performed using the Infinity system screening platform (Nemalife Inc., TX). Specifically, 90 s videos were split into three still image frames (frames 1, 300 and 900), and the Infinity screening system automates a bounding box around every (~70–80) whole animal in the microfluidic chip. Using the Infinity system software (Nemalife Inc., TX), computational coefficients determine animal displacements from outside this bounding box and were used for both lifespan and healthspan analysis. Animals were deemed dead if coefficients were <0.01 (no movement) and alive if values were >0.01. For healthspan analysis, movement rate was employed as one of the most robust measures of animal healthspan. For quantification, animals that obtained coefficients of 0.01–0.40 (i.e., unable to move more than half its body length between subsequent frames) were deemed inactive. Animals with scores of 0.41–1 were classed as ‘active’ animals (i.e., moving half of, or more than its full body‐length in displacement between subsequent frames).\n\nBoth lifespan and healthspan were determined every day using videos of microfluidic‐housed populations. Average values were taken from movement scores between all three frames. In addition to software automation, each video was manually corrected for any false positives/box deformations that could skew movement scores. Daily mean movement values were converted to area under the curve to denote total population movement scores across the entire life course.\n\nZoledronic acid effects on sarcopenia dystrophic progression with age\n\nThe anti‐sarcopenic effects of ZA (1 μM) was visualized and quantified using transgenic strains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐tagged sarcomeres (PJ727 strain: jls01 (myo‐3:: GFP, rol‐6 (su1006)); unc‐54::lacZ V) or GFP‐tagged mitochondria (CB5600 strain: ccIs4251 (Pmyo‐3:: Ngfp‐lacZ; Pmyo‐3:: Mtgfp) I; him‐8 (e1489) IV). Strains were grown on 33 mm plates containing 2 mL NGM agar seeded with 200 μL of OP50 ± ZA, as detailed above. Animals were transferred onto fresh plates every 2 days after young adult stage to remove progeny and prevent population starvation. To image sarcomere and mitochondrial structure, ~30 animals per condition/time point were picked into 20 μL of M9 buffer on a microscope slide (VWR Superfrost, UK) with a cover slip placed on top and imaged immediately using an upright epiflourescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK). Images of the body wall muscles were captured from the head and tail region of each animal (avoiding the mid‐animal/vulva region that exhibits frequent egg‐laying induced tissue disruption) using an Orca‐spark camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) set to 50 ms exposure rate and a gain of 3.4 dB for all acquired images. Approximately 10 individual muscle cells were scored per animal equating to ~300 muscle cells per condition/replicate and scored as either well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscle sarcomere or mitochondria structures as previously described (see Figure S1 for representative images of each class of structural defect). Analysis was carried out in ImageJ, and the number of well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscles were expressed as a percentage of total muscle cells visible and analysed within each animal.\n\nRNA interference and combined zoledronic acid treatments for lifespan and healthspan analysis\n\nThe effects of RNAi treatments on animal lifespan/healthspan were determined using bacterial feeding vectors and performed in the Infinity screening system, as described above. All bacterial lawns expressing double‐stranded RNA were grown from the MRC Ahringer Library of bacterial clones to target (fdps‐1: R06C1.2; daf‐16: R13H8.1; agxt‐2: T09B4.8; igdb‐1: T04A11.3; let‐756: C05D11.4; sir‐2.2: F46G10.7: sir‐2.3: F46G10.3). Each clone was streaked onto LB plates supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and 25 μg/mL carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37°C. Single colonies were then picked into sterile LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and grown for 16 h with shaking at 180 rpm at 37°C. After 16 h incubation, 0.4 mM isopropyl β‐d‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside was added for RNAi induction, with further shaking at 180 rpm for 2 h at 37°C as described previously. After 18 h incubation, tubes were spun at 3000 g for 10 min to obtain bacterial pellets. Liquid NGM was added to each bacterial pellet to reach a final bacteria concentration of 20 mg/mL, adding isopropyl β‐d‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside to a final 1 mM concentration before use. For combined ZA treatments, the same bacterial preparation was performed, but with 20 μL of dilute ZA supplemented to 1 mL of 20 mg/mL OP50 in NGM for a final concentration of 1 μM. On every day of the life course, after washing/recording using the Infinity system as detailed above, ~200 μL of RNAi bacteria ± ZA (1 μM) was injected into the microfluidic chips before storing in petri dishes at 20°C for 24 h until washing/refeeding the next day (with drug dilution/control). All bacteria and drug solutions were prepared fresh daily until cessation of life. RNAi experiments were always conducted alongside empty vector controls (PL4440).\n\nStatistics\n\nLifespan analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier curves assessed by the log‐rank (Mantell–Cox) test. Multiple comparisons of survival curves were performed manually using the Bonferroni‐corrected threshold. For movement rate, area under the curve (AUC) was performed on mean movement values across each day of adulthood (averages taken from across all three frames). AUC values and standard deviations obtained from replicate screens were then assessed by one‐way ANOVA in GraphPad, Prism. Both mitochondrial and sarcomere quantification were analysed by two‐way ANOVA using the percentage classification score from individual animals across biological repeats. All statistics were performed in GraphPad, Prism (San Diego, California USA).",
  "results": "Results\n\nZoledronic acid extends  Caenorhabditis elegans  lifespan and healthspan\n\nHigher ZA concentrations (500 and 100 μM) were larval lethal, and 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (median survival = 11 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001; Figure 1A) without significantly impairing healthspan (animal movement AUC = 758.9 ± 37.08 vs. 833.9 ± 59.91 for controls, P > 0.05; Figure 1A). Conversely, lifespan extension was observed with lower ZA doses of 1 μM (median survival = 16 days, P < 0.001; Figure 1B) and 100 nM (median survival = 16 days, P < 0.0001; Figure 1C). These lifespan‐promoting ZA doses also associated with healthspan extension at 1 μM (AUC = 963.1 ± 48.74, P < 0.05; Figure 1B) and 100 nM (AUC = 953.8 ± 53.77, P < 0.05; Figure 1C) treatments. Additionally, significant movement decline onset became apparent in day 9 control animals (P > 0.01 vs. day 1 adults), which was upheld across all ZA treatment doses at this single time point (+22.2, +31.8 and +17.6% population activity on day 9 vs. untreated controls in 10 μM, 1 μM and 100 nM, respectively). ZA thus acts dose‐dependently to augment animal longevity and health across the life course.\n\nZoledronic acid delays age‐related declines in muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial integrity\n\nTo understand the effects of ZA on progressive sarcomere dystrophy across age, transgenic  C. elegans  expressing GFP‐tagged myosin were treated with 1 μM ZA. Corroborating previous reports on the temporal age‐related loss of sub‐cellular muscle structures, untreated wild‐type animals displayed a significant −35.6% decline in organized myofibrillar structure by day 4 post‐adulthood (P < 0.0001; Figure 2A,B), which worsened to −58.0% by day 6 post‐adulthood (P < 0.0001). ZA delayed loss of organized sarcomeres until day 6 post‐adulthood (−15.6%, P < 0.01), and significantly increased the number of muscle cells displaying organized sarcomeres versus untreated controls at days 4 (83.9% vs. 54.4%) and 6 (71.1% vs. 31.4%) post‐adulthood (both P < 0.0001, Figure 2A,B). ZA also decreased muscle cells categorized as ‘moderately disorganized’ on days 4 (17.0% vs. 38.2%, P < 0.01) and 6 (27.6 vs. 53.4%, P < 0.0001) post‐adulthood and reduced the number of ‘severely disorganized’ muscles on day 6 post‐adulthood (1.8% vs. 13.1%, P < 0.0001).\n\nWe next examined the effects of ZA on mitochondrial integrity, given the strong associations of mitochondrial structure and function with ageing animal health. In line with previous wild‐type ageing studies, loss of networked mitochondria occurred by day 2 post‐adulthood (Figure S2), which progressively worsened at day 4 (−42.6%, P < 0.0001) and day 6 post‐adulthood (−67.0%, P < 0.0001; Figure 3A,B). ZA treatment did not delay the onset of well‐networked mitochondria loss at day 2 (Figure S2) or day 4 post‐adulthood (51.8%, P < 0.0001). However, ZA prevented progressive mitochondrial fragmentation at day 6 post‐adulthood (46.7%, P > 0.05 vs. day 4), which was also significantly higher than in untreated animals (46.7 vs. 16.1%, P < 0.01).\n\nZoledronic acid‐mediated healthspan extension acts through multiple mechanisms\n\nThe lifespan extending effects of ZA have previously been attributed to the mevalonate cholesterol/isoprenoid lipid biosynthesis pathway and the FOXO family of transcription factors, but their role in ZA‐induced healthspan extension is unknown. RNAi knockdown (KD) of fdps‐1, an orthologue of farnesyl diphosphate synthetase involved in the biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate intermediates from mevalonate, impaired survival (median survival = 6 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001) and healthspan (AUC = 287 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population activity for controls, P < 0.0001), which was not improved by co‐treatment with 1 μM ZA (Figure 4A). Similarly, RNAi KD of the daf‐16/FOXO stress response pathway impaired survivability (median survival = 12 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001) and healthspan (AUC = 680.5 ± 23.6 vs. 894.2 ± 17.4 for empty vector, P < 0.01) and prevented the beneficial effects of ZA treatment (Figure 4B).\n\nThe FOXO pathway is a global stress response system, inducible by a wide array of stimuli and a generic transcription factor regulating cellular responses across multiple drug families that integrates multiple upstream signals to influence worm ageing. Alternative, muscle‐centric mechanisms thus also likely contribute to the healthspan benefits of ZA. To probe potential muscle‐derived mechanisms of ZA‐induced healthspan extension, we examined the role of three putative myokines that exhibit altered expression across age and implicated in muscle‐bone crosstalk: agxt‐2/BAIBA, igdb‐1/FNDC5 and let‐756/FGF21. Lifespan and healthspan were unaffected by KD of agxt‐2/BAIBA (β‐aminoisobutyric acid), a muscle‐borne bone protective factor; however, combined agxt‐2 KD with ZA treatment was unable to confer life/healthspan extension (Figure 4C). Conversely, the inhibition of igdb‐1 extended lifespan (median survival = 11 vs. 7 days for controls, P < 0.05) and improved healthspan (AUC = 634.5 ± 10.5 vs. 523 ± 10.0 for controls, P < 0.01), with similar life/healthspan extension observed upon co‐treatment with ZA (Figure 5A). Additionally, let‐756 appears dispensable for ZA‐induced healthspan effects: KD alone caused no significant alterations in survival or movement, whereas increased lifespan and healthspan was retained with combined let‐756 KD and ZA treatment (Figure 5B).\n\nRecent rodent work shows bisphosphonates attenuate denervation‐induced muscle atrophy via downregulation of sirtuin‐3 (SIRT3), one of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)‐dependent deacetylase family members. Because SIRT3 is primarily mitochondrially localized, we examined the role of two  C. elegans  mitochondrial sirtuins, sir‐2.2 and sir‐2.3, for their role in ZA‐mediated lifespan and healthspan extension. Reinforcing a mitochondrial role of sir‐2.2 and sir‐2.3, RNAi KD of each gene caused increased mitochondrial fragmentation at day 0 post‐adulthood (Figure S3). While sir‐2.2 KD did not alter animal survival or healthspan, loss of sir‐2.2 blocked ZA's life extending properties but ZA‐induced healthspan extension remained (Figure 5C). Additionally, and in line with previous reports in  C. elegans , we find that knockdown of sir‐2.3 extends lifespan (Figure 5D) and healthspan (Figure 5H), which remains with combined ZA treatment but is not synergistically beneficial.",
