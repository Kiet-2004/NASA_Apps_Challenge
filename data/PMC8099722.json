  "title": "Reanalysis of the Mars500 experiment reveals common gut microbiome alterations in astronauts induced by long-duration confinement",
  "abstract": "Graphical abstract\n\nMaintaining astronaut health throughout long-duration spaceflight is essential to the feasibility of a manned mission to Mars. The ground-based Mars500 experiment investigated long-duration health by isolating six astronauts for 520 days, the longest controlled human confinement study conducted to date. After 520 days, astronauts had uniform strength and lean body mass losses, and increased fasting plasma glucose, calprotectin, and neutrophil levels characteristic of intestinal inflammation but previous analyses revealed no common significant changes in gut microbiota. This study reanalysed data from early (days 7–45) and late (days 420–520) faecal samples and identified 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs), including 213 shared by all astronauts. Thirty-two ESVs were significantly differentially abundant over time, including depletion of keystone resistant starch degrading, anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitivity-associated species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia luti, Anaerostipes hadrus, Roseburia faecis, and Lactobacillus rogosae, and enrichment of yet-to-be-cultured bacteria. Additionally, the extraordinary experimental confinement allowed observation of microbiota potentially shared between astronauts and their habitat. Forty-nine species were shared, representing 49% and 12% of the human and environmental microbiome diversity, respectively. These findings reveal the microbiota which significantly altered in relative abundance throughout confinement, including species known to influence inflammation and host glucose homeostasis consistent with astronaut symptoms. Identification of microbiome alterations after 520 days of isolation represents a missing piece connecting Mars500 astronaut physiological studies. Knowledge of the impact of long-term confinement upon the human microbiome helps to improve our understanding of how humans interact with their habitats and is a valuable step forward towards enabling long-duration spaceflight.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nThe International Space Exploration Coordination Group, which now comprises 20 national space agencies, recently published the third edition of the Global Exploration Roadmap outlining a strategy to expand human presence in the solar system and setting the surface of Mars as a collaborative target for 2030. Safeguarding astronaut health is a critical factor in meeting this ambitious target. The Canadian Space Agency currently considers the major human health risk categories associated to space flight as: musculoskeletal (reduced muscle strength, aerobic capacity and bone fragility), sensorimotor (visual impairment), metabolic (nutritional status and sickness), behavioural health and performance (stress, fatigue, cognitive deterioration and wellbeing), radiation (ultraviolet and ionising), autonomous medical care (medical access), and physiological adaptation to variable gravity and environmental stressors (including human-associated microbial communities). These challenges are magnified in long-duration space flight, such as during a two–three year mission to Mars, where no resupply of air, water, food or medical supplies is possible, radiation and microgravity exposure will be for longer than has yet been tested, and abortion of a mission due to crew illness will not be possible.\n\nWhile the human gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome is still being explored, it is considered essential for long-term maintenance of many aspects of human health, including healthy nutritional, immune, metabolic and psychophysiological function. Long-duration habitat confinement, such as that faced by astronauts during spaceflight, could interrupt the dialog between environmental microbial ecosystems and the human microbiome. Previous research has established that confined habitats subject to strict cleaning procedures on Earth, such as intensive care units and surgical theatres, as well as those in space, can produce a unique surface environment dominated by human GIT microbiome. The influence of confinement upon the microbiome has been studied recently in four astronauts over 60 days by Chen et al using bioregenerative life support systems (confined and self-sufficient ecosystems). Although no common microbiome composition was observed over time they did report a potential non-significant trend of depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii as well as large individual differences between individuals (expected in microbiome studies with very low participant numbers). Whether confinement can influence the GIT microbiome of long-term inhabitants is an important priority for future space missions and was directly addressed in the longest-running human confined habitat experiment conducted to date, the Mars500 experiment.\n\nThe Mars500 experiment isolated six astronauts within an analogue Mars-surface habitat. After 520 days, the six astronauts emerged as largely healthy, but the long-term confinement had significantly altered some of their physiology. Research conducted by Strollo et al. measured significant decreases in total body mass (−9.3%), BMI (−5.4%) and lean (non-fat) mass (−11.8%) by day 417 of isolation. When considered alongside significant increases in fasting plasma glucose from a healthy median of 4.65 mmol/L at the beginning of the experiment to prediabetic levels of 6.02 mmol/L (impaired fasting glucose), these findings are indicative of potential disruption in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in astronauts after extensive confinement. This aligned with significant losses of up to 22% of quadriceps/hamstring strength in astronauts, observed by Gaffney et al.. In parallel, Roda et al. observed that the loss of body mass was accompanied by a significant increase in the faecal protein calprotectin, the intestinal inflammation biomarker making up 60% of neutrophils (the cells which characterise intestinal inflammation); from calprotectin negative in astronauts at the beginning of the experiment, towards varying degrees of positive by day 475. Further supporting this general trend towards an onset of intestinal inflammation, Yi et al. directly observed a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophils in the Mars500 astronauts after the 520 days of isolation, symptoms which are commonly observed in astronauts during space flight. While Strollo et al. hypothesised that the observed symptoms accompanied by an increase in calprotectin in later faecal samples could be indicative of common metabolic alterations associated with intestinal inflammation, they discounted any microbiome interactions due to prior research conducted by Turroni et al., which did not identify significant microbiome changes over time and found only 14 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, representing putative microbiome species) were shared between the six astronauts. Here, the potential for common microbiome change in the Mars500 astronauts over time is reassessed using improved 16S rRNA gene amplicon bioinformatics technology and a common data normalisation strategy for all six astronauts.",
  "methods": "Materials and methods\n\nSample collection and microbiome sequencing\n\nThe Mars500 experiment was a ground-based human isolation study conducted over 520 days which aimed to simulate a manned mission to Mars. The study participants were all male and their ages ranged from 29 to 40. Faecal samples used for analysis here were taken on the days 7, 14, 21, 30 and 45 (early) and days 420, 450, 490, 504, 520 of the Mars500 experiment (Supplementary file 1). Sampling, DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing approaches were not conducted in this study but are reported in. Briefly, the authors report that total DNA was isolated from faeces using a modified bead-beating and column extraction with QIAamp DNA Stool miniKit. Amplification used 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 805R (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) primers targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable region and amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform (2 × 300 bp paired-end). Raw sequences available in NCBI SRA BioProject PRJNA358005 or from https://genelab.nasa.gov/.\n\nMars500 habitat environmental samples used for analysis were taken from surfaces using swabs on the days 14, 44, 436, 467, 496 to correspond to faecal microbiome sampling and were from the utility, medical or habitat modules (Supplementary file 1). Sampling, DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing approaches were not conducted in this study but are reported in. Briefly, the authors report that total DNA was isolated from surfaces using a 552C regular ethylene oxide sterilized swab moistened with PCR grade H2O. Total DNA was extracted using a FastDNA SPIN Kit. Amplification used 515f (5′-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 926r (5′-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT-3′) primers targeting the V4 hypervariable region and amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform (2 × 300 bp paired-end). Raw sequences were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive accession number: PRJEB21072.\n\nData processing\n\nAmplicon sequence reads were processed and annotated using Anchor. The amplicon terminology of exact sequence variants (ESV) are used in place of operational taxonomic unit as no 97% similarity clustering is used. Sequences were aligned and dereplicated using Mothur and an ESV count threshold of 18 for the astronaut faecal microbiome dataset and 30 for the Mars500 habitat dataset. Annotation at family, genera or species-level used BLASTn criteria of BLASTn criteria of >99% identity and coverage to the NCBI curated bacterial and Archaea RefSeq and NCBI nr/nt databases (January 2020 versions). All annotation calls are putative despite >99% similarity, as databases are subject to change as discoveries are made and phylogenies revised. Reporting of 100% similar sequence matches to unique species is more accurate than reporting such hits at higher taxon levels; however, all annotation should be considered as putative and interpreted with care. Differentially abundant ESVs annotated from the NCBI nr/nt database were manually assessed for quality. Annotation improvement is possible as databases improve/expand using the sequences provided with each ESV in Supplementary file 1. When the highest identity/coverage is shared amongst multiple different putative annotation, all annotation is retained and reported. Amplicons with low-counts (<30 or <18) are binned to high-count sequences in a second BLASTn, using a lower threshold of >98% identity/coverage.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe normalisation strategy conducted by Turroni et al. was distinct for each astronaut to allow observation of individual microbiome change in steady states over time. While this described some unique elements of each astronaut, the strategy made observation of common OTUs challenging. Here, while the limited biological replication of 6n (astronauts) could not be altered, the variation introduced from single replicate stool sampling could be reduced by pooling libraries from the first five samples and from the final five samples to improve representation of early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) microbiome states of the each astronaut. Samples selected to represent early and late periods of confinement were defined as the first and last set of five samples taken from all six astronauts and the libraries were pooled in silico per astronaut and period. These timepoints also represent the samples available for all six astronauts which best aligned with the Mars500 physiology studies measuring astronaut body mass, strength, faecal protein calprotectin and immune responses. Differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2, which performs well with 16S rRNA gene amplicon data and uneven library sizes. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) < 0.1 was applied. Sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single sample is <90% of the count in all samples and ESV counts must be >0 in at least 3 samples from the same group (early or late). Constrained ordination analysis was performed using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP; Fig. 2) with the 1-dimensional constraint (early vs late) represented on the x-axis and the first axis of non-constrained ordination (multidimensional scaling) on the y-axis. This analysis was performed with the Vegan library on R via the capscale function.\n\nData and code availability\n\nANCHOR code is available at https://github.com/gonzalezem/ANCHOR. ESV tables including relative abundance, annotation, count distribution, blast statistics, alternative database hits, and sequences are provided in Supplementary file 1.",
  "results": "Results\n\nMars500 astronaut gastrointestinal track microbiome community overview\n\nA total of 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were assembled and captured 71.78% of the total 4,837,317 amplicons sequenced, including 213 ESVs present in all six astronauts in the early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) samples alone (Supplementary file 1). Amplicon lengths ranged between 439 and 466 nt. All ESVs were annotated as >99% similar sequence identity: 162 ESVs as putative species (including 14 which were ambiguous sequences to multiple species), 47 ESVs at genera-level, 34 at family-level, while 165 were poorly classified or unknown (<99% similarity to any well-characterised taxa) (Fig. 1). ESVs which could be annotated at species-level had an average identity of 99.92% (135 ESVs had 100% sequence similarity) and captured 67% of counts, those annotated at genera-level averaged 99.83% identity and captured 7% of counts, whereas those annotated at family-level averaged 99.92% identity and captured 11% of counts. ESVs identified from the phylum Firmicutes were the most prevalent, making up 64% of counts, while 7% were from Bacteroidetes, 6% from Actinobacteria, 6% from Verrucomicrobia, 2% from Proteobacteria and 15% were from unknown organisms.\n\nThe ESVs which could be confidently identified as putative species with the highest relative abundance across all astronauts in the phylum Firmicutes were all Clostridia, including Agathobacter_rectalis_1 with 10.1% of total counts, Gemmiger_formicilis_1 with 3.5%, Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_3 with 3.3%, Fusicatenibacter_saccharivorans_1 with 2.5% and Blautia_wexlerae_1 with 2.1% (Supplementary file 1). In Verrucomicrobia, two distinct ESVs had high relative abundance, Akkermansia_muciniphilia_1 with 3.5% of total counts and Akkermansia_muciniphilia_2 with 2.3% (both having 100% similarity to distinct strain groups, ie. JCM30893 and BSH01), whereas Bacteroides_dorei_1 had the highest relative abundance in the phylum Bacteroidetes with 1.2% of total counts. The ESVs with the highest relative abundance from the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were both ambiguous, with the amplified sequence identical between multiple species (ESVs labelled as _MS), Enterobacterales_MS_1 (sequence common to Brenneria alni, Escherichia coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Shigella flexneri or Shigella sonnei) and Bifidobacterium_MS_2 (sequence common to Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium faecale or Bifidobacterium stercoris).\n\nSignificant microbiome changes identified across astronauts over time\n\nTo determine whether there were common microbiome changes over time, a simplified experimental design was used to compare the first five samples (7–45 days) and the last five samples (420–520 days) taken from all six astronauts (Fig. 2). When comparing early with late GIT microbiome samples taken from all six astronauts, alpha-diversity (Shannon and inverse Simpson) indices were not significantly different in estimated diversity between groups (t-tests p > 0.05). Canonical analysis of principal coordinates suggests samples separated by early and late groups (Fig. 2) and multivariate analysis identified significant variance between the groups (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001). To identify which ESVs were significantly altered in relative abundance over time, differential abundance analysis was performed. Thirty-one ESVs were significantly different between timepoints, including 16 significantly enriched and 15 significantly depleted in late samples compared to early samples.\n\nESVs higher in relative abundance in late astronaut samples\n\nThe 16 ESVs in significantly higher relative abundance in the astronauts after 420–520 days of confinement were all poorly characterised with the exception of Streptococcus_thermophilus_1 (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). Five ESVs have been putatively placed at genera or family levels (Fig. 2): Kineothrix_1, Lachnospiraceae_10, Ruminococcus_3, Ruminococcaceae_1 and Christensenellaceae_1. The remaining ten differentially abundant ESV are classified here as unknown (<99% similarity to previously identified taxa), although all have previously been observed as unknown bacteria at >99% sequence similarity.\n\nKineothrix_1 and Lachnospiraceae_10 were both most similar to the Kineothrix alysoides strain KNHs209, with 97.50% and 98.41% similar sequence identity, respectively. The ESV Kineothrix_1 did share 100% similarity to a genome assembled from work sequencing difficult to culture (yet-to-be-cultured) microbiome species from the human GIT (uncultured Clostridium sp. isolate 2789STDY5608883). Ruminococcus_3 is commonly observed at 100% sequence similarity (as an unknown bacteria) in human GIT microbiome studies (for example NCBI:AM275462) and has previously been classified as Ruminococcus sp. strain 95 (unpublished, but most similar to Ruminococcus bromii YE282 genome) although the most similar well-characterised species was the type strain Ruminococcus bromii ATCC 27255 (97.97% similar). Ruminococcaceae_1 and Christensenellaceae_1, although also commonly observed as unknown bacteria in human faecal samples at 100% sequence similarity, were both highly dissimilar to any known bacterial species (<94% 16S rRNA sequence similarity).\n\nThe ten unknown sequences identified as significantly differentially abundant and enriched in astronauts after long-term confinement included the three ESVs, Unknown_254, Unknown_268 and Unknown_354, sharing 96–97% similarity to the known species, Anaerocolumna cellulosilytica, Monoglobus pectinilyticus and Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, respectively. The seven remaining unknown ESVs had <90% sequence similarity to any known species but have all been previously observed as unknown bacteria (at >99% sequence similarity) in GIT samples of humans as well as other animals. Two of these ESVs, Unknown_309 (the highest in relative abundance) and Unknown_49, shared 100% sequence similarity with genomes recently assembled by Almeida et al. in breakthrough research targeting yet-to-be-uncultured species in humans with de novo whole genome shotgun techniques (uncultured Clostridium sp. isolates UMGS1238 and UMGS1543) (Fig. 3). The Unknown_309 sequence has also recently been observed (100% sequence similarity) and classified by Hynönen et al. as the “Ct85 cluster” of uncultured GIT bacteria in mammals (AP10s.319, LR595742.1 Ct85 type-f), alongside other ESVs present in astronauts but which did not significantly vary over time: Unknown_40 (AP07s.345 Ct85 type-d), Unknown_104 (AP07s.302 Ct85 untyped) and Unknown_38 (AP07s.190 Ct85 type-b).\n\nESVs lower in relative abundance in late astronaut samples\n\nAfter 420–520 days in isolation, 15 ESVs were significantly lower in relative abundance in astronauts. These were better characterised than those enriched over time, including ten ESVs which could be annotated at species level (Fig. 2). These putative species included four distinct Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ESVs (labelled here as Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_1, 3, 4 and 5), Ruminococcus_bromii_2, Blautia_luti_2, Anaerostipes_hadrus_1, Roseburia_faecis_1 and Lactobacillus_rogosae_1, as well as the ambiguous ESV Clostridium_MS_1, which shared 100% sequence similarity to both Clostridium disporicum and Clostridium saudiense. Additionally, two EVSs were poorly characterised at genera level, Roseburia_1 and Lachnospira_1, and three were unknown sequences, Unknown_181, Unknown_220 and Unknown_83.\n\nSix F. prausnitzii ESVs in total were identified in astronauts, with 4/6 significantly changing in relative abundance, reducing over time in all four cases. All of the ESVs corresponded to known strain groups with 100% similarity (Fig. 3); depleted ESVs were Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_1 (identical to the type strain F. prausnitzii ATCC27768 in phylogroup I/subgroup-A), Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_3 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4546; 4573; 4644; M21/2 in phylogroup I/subgroup-A), Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_4 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4544; 4542 in phylogroup IIa/subgroup-C) and Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_5 (identical to F. prausnitzii APC942/32 in phylogroup IIb/outgroup). The two F. prausnitzii ESVs which didn’t significantly vary between confinement time were Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_2 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4543; 4574; A2-165 PacBio phylogroup IIb/subgroup-B) and Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_6 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4575 phylogroup IIb/outgroup).\n\nA direct comparison between the Mars500 astronaut and habitat microbiome communities\n\nTo assess the degree to which the astronauts’ microbiomes was associated with their habitat, the surface microbiome of the Mars500 modules, reported by Schwendner et al., was directly compared after reanalysis. A total of 1494 ESVs were assembled from 135 habitat samples, capturing 88.02% of the total 23,417,169 amplicons sequenced (Fig. 4). Amplicon lengths (>0.1% of counts) ranging between 403 and 426 nt. Seven hundred and ninety ESVs could be annotated as putative species (including 341 which were ambiguous sequences to multiple species), 167 ESVs at genera-level, 21 at family-level, while 305 were poorly classified or unknown (<99% similarity to any well-characterised taxa). ESVs which could be annotated at species-level had an average identity of 99.95% (790 ESVs had 100% sequence similarity) and captured 88.39% of counts, those annotated at genera-level averaged 99.85% identity and captured 3.20% of counts, whereas those annotated at family-level averaged 99.88% identity and captured 0.40% of counts.\n\nThe V3-V4 16S rRNA gene primer pair used to assess the astronaut GIT microbiome, 341F and 805R, was distinct to the V4 16S rRNA gene primer pair used to assess the Mars500 habitat microbiome, 515F and 926R. To directly compare the astronaut and habitat microbiome datasets, ESVs annotated at species level from each experiment were aligned directly. Alignment of each library revealed 79/162 astronaut ESVs had an identical overlapping V4 hypervariable sequence region (252–253 nts) with one or more of 98/790 habitat ESVs (12.4% of total species), 42 of which were single astronaut-habitat ESV pairs unique to a single species. When gene sequences from genome assemblies were used as scaffolds for astronaut-habitat (gut-environment) ESV pairs, a total of 49 Scaffolded Amplicons (ScAmps) aligned as 100% identical to reference genomes (Fig. 5). Astronaut-habitat ScAmps allowed for improved resolution of distinct 16S rRNA gene sequences and taxonomic annotation. Examples where two distinct taxa could be distinguished using ScAmps but could not from a single primer pair included distinct Anaerostipes hadrus, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides caccae and Eggerthella lenta strain groups. The increased length and hypervariable region coverage of ScAmps, between 557 and 590 nt, resolved ESV annotation ambiguity in 8 cases, identifying two distinct Veillonella parvula strain groups (NCTC11810 and UTDB1-3) in the astronaut microbiome, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis in the habitat microbiome, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis in both.",
