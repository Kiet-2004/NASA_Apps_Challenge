  "introduction": "This is a correction to: James F Fleming, Davide Pisani, Kazuharu Arakawa, The Evolution of Temperature and Desiccation-Related Protein Families in Tardigrada Reveals a Complex Acquisition of Extremotolerance, Genome Biology and Evolution, Volume 16, Issue 1, January 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evad217\n\nIn the originally published online version of this manuscript, details in the caption to Figure 7 were errored.\n\nThese should read: “[…]CAHS is represented in red, MAHS in purple, SAHS in green, EtAHS alpha in yellow, EtAHS beta in pink, and MRE11 in blue.[…]” instead of: “[…] CAHS is represented in blue, MAHS in purple, SAHS in green, EtAHS alpha in red, EtAHS beta in orange, and MRE11 in black.[…]”.\n\nThese errors are outlined only in this correction notice to preserve the version of record.",
