  "title": "Post-Spaceflight (STS-135) Mouse Splenocytes Demonstrate Altered Activation Properties and Surface Molecule Expression",
  "abstract": "Alterations in immune function have been documented during or post-spaceflight and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ cells, lower percentage of CD11c+MHC II+ cells, and higher percentage of CD11c+MHC I+ populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4+ population but increased CD4+CD25+ cells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c+ population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD11c+MHC I+, CD11c+MHC II+, and CD11c+CD86+ cells compared to ground controls. Production of IFN-γ was decreased and IL-2 was increased from ConA stimulated flight splenocytes. This study demonstrated that expression of surface molecules can be affected by conditions of spaceflight and impaired responsiveness persists under culture conditions in vitro.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nSince the beginning of space travel, there have been reports of reoccurring/opportunistic infections during and post-spaceflight, likely resulting from immune suppression associated with mission parameters. Cosmonauts developed acute respiratory issues after prolonged spaceflight, and astronauts on Apollo and Skylab missions experienced increased infections. Published reports documented an increase in reactivation of latent viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Varicella-Zoster virus) pre-, during, and post-spaceflight compared to healthy ground control individuals. Multiple factors were cited to alter host immune function of viral control, with stress parameters being the marker of highest correlative value. Viral reactivation is often accompanied by elevated stress hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Additionally, shifts in circulating cytokines towards high levels of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-8 were observed in astronauts found shedding viral particles.\n\nStudies on spaceflight impact on immune function have been investigated through analysis of blood leukocytes obtained from astronauts, cells secured from space flown mice and rats, and in vitro cell culture systems. Several changes in cell populations have been noted immediately post-spaceflight, including decreased total leukocytes, decreased T-cells (specifically CD4+ T-cells), increased monocytes, increased granulocytes, and decreased natural killer cells. However, reports of alterations in circulating leukocytes populations isolated from astronauts post-spaceflight are at best inconsistent; other analyses found no changes in lymphocyte or monocytes populations. The inconsistency of the data is most likely due to mission specific variables and individual health status.\n\nThe observed changes in immune activity post-spaceflight involves both innate (macrophages and NK cells) and adaptive (T-cell) functions. This report represents the first occasion of a detailed analysis of both surface marker expression and response to stimulation parameters that mimic a broad range of pathogen induced activation events. In order to answer these questions, this study focused on mouse splenocyte composition and function immediately post 13 days of spaceflight, utilizing animals that were part of the historic final flight of NASA’s Space Shuttle Program (Space Shuttle Atlantis, STS-135). Innate stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLR), the surface receptors that target molecular pathogenic patterns, examined activation events using agonists employed primarily by bacterial or fungal agents. These included zymosan (TLR-2 agonist), lipopolysacchride (LPS; TLR-4 agonist), and flagellin (TLR-5 agonist).The adaptive stimulation parameters included T-cell stimulation using antibodies to stimulate CD3 (T-cell receptor) and CD28 (T-cell co-receptor), or via mitogen, concanvalin A, to bypass the CD28 co-receptor.\n\nAnalysis of mouse splenocytes focused on changes in surface marker expression for T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs), marking a distinction between innate and adaptive immunity. DCs activate upon innate TLR stimulation, leading to increased expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I and II) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD86 and 80). Upon cell-cell contact with DCs, CD8+ (MHC I) or CD4+ (MHC II) T-cells are activated by antigen recognition through the T-cell receptor (CD3 is the signal transduction region) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD28. The goal of these studies was to determine the influence of spaceflight on immune activity known important for translating innate immune responses to long-lasting T-cell hypersensitive activity.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nFlight Information: Subjects and Spaceflight\n\nThis study was conducted as a subset of a larger parent flight investigation identified as Commercial Biomedical Test Module-3, designed to determine if administering an experimental agent preflight reduces the loss of bone associated with spaceflight; multiple investigators shared materials collected post flight. For the parent study, mice (“flight mice”) were flown onboard Space Shuttle Atlantis, mission STS-135, for approximately 13 days. For this immune-specific sub-study, approximately ½ spleen from six C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, 9 weeks of age at start of flight) were made available immediately following spaceflight. The subjects were flown in a Space Shuttle Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), which was housed in the mid-deck area of the vehicle for the duration of the spaceflight. Spleens from six ground-based control mice, which were handled and housed in a ground-based identical manner (AEM module) to the flight mice were included in the study. The AEM module housing conditions for control mice have been well described. AEM ground control mice received vehicle control diluting agent.\n\nThe mice were part of the NASA Ames Research Center’s Biospecimen Sharing Program (http://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/cbtm-3-sts-135). Flight experiments were designed to investigate effects of microgravity on vascular atrophy in mouse hindlimbs. We are aware that among our six flight mouse subjects, four were treated with a bone-specific medication and two were untreated. For purposes of this article, analysis was conducted on all six flight subjects as a group, without knowledge of treatment, and data were compared to ground AEM control subjects. The individual mice that were drug or placebo treated remained unknown during experimentation; data presented here was not separated according to treatments. To our knowledge, there was no influence of medication on the data collected. Separate analysis of data did not indicate statistical outliers within the combined spaceflight mice, which would indicate affects due to treatment. In light of this, we believe our findings are relevant and important, even in light of inclusion of mice that received the bone loss experimental drug.\n\nMouse Splenocytes Processing\n\nAnimals were retrieved approximately 1 hour following deorbit, and sacrificed within 3–5 hours post flight, collected on July 21, 2011 at Kennedy Space Center (Cape Canaveral, FL). Mice were euthanized using 4% isoflurane followed by cardiac puncture and exsanguinations. Half of the spleen was processed as previously described. Briefly, the organ was homonenized between glass slides, RBC lysed with ACK buffer (Lonza), washed twice with 1x Cellgro Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS, Mediatech), and cultured in complete DMEM media [Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2.2g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.05g/L of HEPES (Sigma), 0.05g/L L-arginine (Sigma), 100 μg/mL penicillin G (Sigma), 50 μg/mL gentamycin sulfate (Sigma) 0.005% 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma)] at 1x106cells/mL. Processing of splenocytes for in vitro analysis occurred within 4 hours post flight. The animal welfare committee at the University of Texas Health Science Center was consulted prior to initiation of experimentation; no protocol was required as samples used were obtained post euthanasia. All NASA activities with these mice were performed according to guidelines stipulated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as described by the National Institutes of Health. Experiments were performed after approval by review boards associated with NASA’s standard operating procedures, and as reported for tissue used in recent reports.\n\nBead Uptake Assay\n\nSplenocytes were cultured with 1.0μm FluoSpheres polystyrene microsphere (Invitrogen) at ratio of 10 beads per 1 cell. At 2 hours, cells were washed with 1x PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes on ice, and stored in flow buffer (1% BSA in 1x PBS) for analysis.\n\nStimulation Assays\n\nIsolated splenocytes were cultured for 24 hours in media alone or stimulated with 1) anti-CD3 (0.1μg/mL) and anti-CD28 (0.1μg/mL) antibodies (eBiosciences), 2) 2μg/mL Concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma), 3) 200ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS, O111:B4, Sigma), 4) 10μg/mL Zymosan (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Invivogen), or 5) 100ng/mL flagellin (Salmonella typhimurium, Invivogen). At 24 hours, supernatants were collected for ELISA and cells collected for staining of surface markers.\n\nFlow Cytometry\n\nIdentification of surface molecule expression by flow cytometric analysis was conducted as previously described. Briefly, samples were blocked by incubating purified anti-CD16/32 (Fc block, BD Biosciences) on ice for 15 minutes. Then, samples were stained with mouse specific T-cell markers or DC markers antibody cocktails in staining buffer (1% BSA in 1xPBS) on ice for 45–60mins. T-cell marker cocktail: CD4-FITC, CD8-PE, CD28-PECy5, CD-25-PECy7, and CTLA-4-APC. DC marker cocktail: H2Kb-FITC, I-Ab-PE, CD86-PECy5, CD11c-PECy7, and CD80-APC. Stained samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 15 mins. Stained and fixed samples were stored in 500μL of staining buffer. Samples were read on Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Analysis was conducted with Cyflogic.\n\nCytokine Analysis\n\nSupernatants were analyzed by DuoSet (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s protocol as previously described. Supernatants were analyzed for inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) and lymphocyte cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ). Lower limits of detection for the assay were between 16–32 pg/mL.\n\nStatistics\n\nSplenocytes were collected from 6 mice per group. Flow analysis counted 20,000 events per sample. ELISA analysis was conducted in duplicate or triplicate. Data was analyzed by TwoWay ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. Significance is considered when p<0.05.",
  "results": "Results\n\nSplenocyte Population Changes between Flight Mice and Ground Controls\n\nBasic differentiation of splenocyte cell populations between flight mice and matched ground controls were completed by flow cytometric analysis. Forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters were noted, with the former measuring size of particle and the latter measuring granularity. Cells were assessed immediately post 13 days in flight, or following short term culture in vitro. Distinct changes in total splenocyte population were noted. Native splenocytes collected from spleens immediate upon sacrifice demonstrated two distinct cell populations, based on FS. The flight mice splenocytes selectively demonstrated presence of a third population within gate 3 (G3) with higher FS compared to ground controls (Fig 1a). Fig 1b shows representative dot plots of cell population makeup within each gate identified in Fig 1a. There are clear population differences in cells expressing CD4, CD8, MHC I and MHC II (Fig 1b). Examination of T-cell and antigen presentation cell markers on the different cell populations found that G3 cells contained a higher percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ cells compared to G1 and G2 populations. The G3 population also had increased surface expression of MHC I compared to G1 and G2 cells (Fig 1c). This indicates that post-spaceflight mice have spleens with slightly higher CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations compared to matched ground controls.\n\nUpon culture for 24 hours in cell media, relative marker expression for the splenocyte population shifted. Cultured splenocytes isolated from ground control mice exhibited an increase in cell density in G3 compared to cultured splenocytes isolated from flight mice (Fig 2a). Examination revealed that G3 population has higher percentage of CD8+ and MHC I+ cells. It was also noted that G3 population also displayed increased surface expression of CD8+ as indicated by increased mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). Cell populations of G2 and G4 display surface marker expression typical of dendritic cells and macrophages (Fig 2b and 2c). These data suggests that in vitro culturing of splenocytes from ground control mice enhances relative abundance of CD8 T-cell marker expression compared to splenocytes collected from the mice post-spaceflight.\n\nSplenocyte Markers Altered Post-Spaceflight\n\nWith obvious differences in cell population observed from splenocytes collected from ground control versus flight mice within hours post-spaceflight, detailed examination of surface marker changes were conducted. In addition to changes in overall T-cell and dendritic cell populations, markers important for T-cell activation and proliferation and dendritic cell antigen presentation were also examined (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nAnalysis of cell populations indicated that the majority of lymphocytes resided within the G2 and G3 gated areas. As such, examination of changes in T-cell populations was restricted to G2 and G3 events. T-cell markers of interest examined are CD4, CD8, CD28 (the second signal for T-cell activation), CD25 (IL-2 receptor), and CTLA-4 (the signal for T-cell anergy). No differences were observed in percent of splenocytes expressing these surface markers between flight and ground control mice. However, several significant changes were observed in the intensity of surface marker expression. Splenocytes from flight mice had a significant decrease in CD4 MFI, with a concurrent increase in CD8 MFI, compared to ground controls. The intensity of CD25 expression in both CD4 and CD8 cells were significantly decreased in splenocytes from flight mice compared to ground controls (Table 1). Little to no CTLA-4 expression was detected from any of the samples (data not shown).\n\nExamination of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules were focused on events occurring in cells gated within G1, G2, and G3. There was a significant increase in population of splenocytes expressing the dendritic cell marker (CD11c) from flight mice compared to ground controls. A similar increase was also observed in dendritic cells (CD11c+) expressing MHC I. However, a significant decrease was detected in dendritic cells co-expressing MHC II from splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls (Table 2).\n\nPost-Spaceflight Splenocytes Increased Ability to Uptake Particles\n\nA central process in innate immunity is the ability to phagocytose. To examine if post-spaceflight conditions affected the ability of splenocytes to uptake particles, splenocytes were incubated with fluorescent beads, and analyzed for bead ingestion conducted by flow cytometry.\n\nThree distinct populations for positive bead uptake were detected, and labeled as low, medium, high according to florescent intensity (FI). Cells from G1, G2, and G3 were considered as one population and distinguished only by FI. Splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated a significant increase in percent positive cells at low and medium FI, and a non-significant increase at high FI compared to ground controls (Fig 3).\n\nChanges in T-cell Surface Molecules upon Stimulation\n\nNext, changes in T-cells surface marker expression post stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and Concanavalin A (ConA) were examined. The total population of CD4+ cells was significantly decreased in splenocytes collected from flight mice in all cultured conditions (media control, CD3/28, or ConA) compared to ground controls. Additionally, stimulation of cultured cells also caused a downward trend of CD4 expressing cells compared to culturing in media control (Fig 4a). There was no significant difference in cell population expressing both CD4 and CD28 (Fig 4b). Stimulation with ConA dramatically increased the CD4+CD25+ population, with a significant decrease observed in splenocytes from flight mice compared to ground controls (Fig 4c). A similar increase in CD4 cell population co-expressing CD28 and CD25 was observed during ConA stimulation. An unexpected finding was that CD4+ splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated and increase in CD28/25 co-expressing cells compared to ground controls (Fig 4d).\n\nPrevious observations in our laboratory demonstrated that the action of in vitro culturing leads to altered cell population (non-published observation). For example, simple in vitro culturing of splenocytes in media alters intensity of CD8 expression. This was now examined in the post-flight group. After 24 hours in cell media, splenocytes, from both flight and ground controls, developed two distinct CD8+ cell populations based on mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). The populations were termed CD8lo+ and CD8hi+. Upon stimulation with ConA for 24 hours, this distinction disappears and most of the CD8+ splenocytes are CD8lo+ (Fig 5).\n\nExamination of CD8 expression during stimulation is divided between CD8lo and CD8hi populations. There is little if any change in CD8 expression among the media control and CD3/28 and Con A stimulated groups. However, CD8hi expression is very low after stimulation with ConA. No significant differences between splenocytes isolated from flight mice or ground controls in all culture conditions. The exception is the observation of a significant increase in CD25+CD28+ expression of CD8+ T-cells from splenocytes of flight mice compared to ground controls (Fig 6).\n\nPresentation and Activation Molecule Changes in Splenocytes during TLR Stimulation\n\nEffective immunity against pathogens relies on innate recognition of molecular patterns and activation of antigen presentation. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are well characterized pattern recognition receptors that initiate activation of the innate response. Using agonists for TLR-2 (Zymosan), TLR-4 (LPS), and TLR-5 (flagellin), splenocytes were stimulated for 24 hours and analyzed for surface expression of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules.\n\nSurface expression of MHC I from flight mice or ground controls demonstrated two distinct populations. One population exhibited low intensity of MHC I expression that is well confined to G3. The other population had a diverse intensity range of MHC I expression that was generally higher compared to those in G2 (Fig 7a). Analysis of MHC I allowed grouping into MHC Ilo (G3) and MHC Ihi (G2) populations. In percent population analysis of MHC I expression, no differences were observed for any of the TLR agonist conditions between splenocytes isolated from flight mice or ground controls. Interestingly, there was an across the board decrease of MHC I MFI from splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls in the G2 (MHC Ihi) population. This trend was completely reversed in the G3 (MHC Ilo) population in MHC I MFI, with splenocytes from flight mice demonstrating a significant increase in expression intensity compared to ground controls (Fig 7b). No differences were observed in expression of MHC II between flight mice and ground controls (data not shown).\n\nExpression of CD11c, a mouse dendritic cell marker, showed that splenocytes from flight mice had a global decrease in expression of CD11c positive cells under all culture conditions (Fig 8a). These dendritic cell populations were investigated for expression of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. CD11c+MCHI+ cells were decreased in both percent population and intensity of MHC I expression in all culture conditions in flight mice splenocytes compared to ground controls (Fig 8b). CD11c+MHCII+ splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated increased in percent population and intensity of MHC II expression compared to ground controls (Fig 8c). There was little difference between flight mice and ground controls in CD11c+CD86+ splenocytes, except a significant decrease in CD11c+CD86+ cells under TLR-5 stimulation (Fig 8d). Finally, there was very low overall expression of CD80 (data not shown).\n\nCytokine Production from Stimulated Splenocytes Post-Spaceflight\n\nThe changes in surface expression of T-cell activation molecules, as well as dendritic cell antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules, during stimulation indicated potential functional dysregulation caused by spaceflight. Cytokine production during stimulation is often used to determine cell activity. Supernatants from splenocytes stimulated with T-cell stimulants or TLR agonists were further examined for cytokine production by ELISA.\n\nStimulation with ConA demonstrated a non-significant trend of increased IFN-γ production and a concurrent decrease in IL-2 production from flight mice splenocytes compared to ground controls (Table 3). TLR-2 and TLR-4 agonists also stimulated an increase in production of TNF-α and IL-6 from splenocytes isolated from flight mice versus ground controls. Only the increase in TNF-α induced by TLR-2 agonist represented a significant difference (Table 4). Little (below the level of detection of the assay) to no TNF-α and IL-6 were produced when stimulated with TLR-5 agonist (data not shown).",
