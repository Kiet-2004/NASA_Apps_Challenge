  "abstract": "SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans-Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans-Golgi. As single atgtlp−/− mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nAn efficient and well-organized intracellular transport system is a basic requirement for life to exist, as many components necessary for metabolic processes, that take place inside or outside of a eukaryotic cell, are produced and subsequently modified in different cell compartments. The transport system responsible for delivering cargo collected from one compartment (that is: a membrane-enclosed organelle, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or vacuole) to its next destination has been given the name of “membrane traffic”.\n\nIn the membrane traffic, macromolecules are packed as cargo into vesicles, which then carry the cargo to another organelle, plasma membrane or extracellular space. SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins, a family of membrane-anchored proteins comprising of more than 60 members in Arabidopsis, play an important role in this transport system. Assisted by other molecules, such as Rab GTPases and tethering factors, SNAREs mediate fusion between the membrane of vesicle carrying the cargo and the membrane of the organelle the cargo is addressed to. To facilitate the fusion, SNAREs form a complex comprising of four SNAREs—three Q-SNAREs (Qa-, Qb-, Qc-SNARE), which reside on the target membrane and are characterized by the presence of glutamine as the central amino acid in SNARE motif, in addition to one R-SNARE residing on the transport vesicle, with arginine as the central amino acid. When a R-SNARE comes into contact with the three Q-SNAREs, first a link is formed between the vesicle and the target membrane, and subsequently, due to the change in conformation of the SNARE complex from “loose” to “tight” state, the vesicle is pulled toward the target membrane, allowing the two membranes to fuse together and the cargo to enter the lumen of the organelle. To ensure the specificity of fusion, a large number of SNAREs localizes selectively to a specific cell compartment. This characteristic made it possible for those SNAREs to be successfully used as organelle markers in subcellular localization studies.\n\nThrough their crucial role in membrane trafficking, members of SNARE family in plants were reported to be implicit in a variety of biological processes, ranging from growth to biotic/abiotic stress resistance. One group of SNAREs, that has been linked to secretion-dependent resistance against pathogens, is SYP4 (SYNTAXIN of PLANTs 4) group. SYP4 group comprises of three members (SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43) with partially overlapping functions, all localizing to the TGN (trans-Golgi network). syp42−/−syp43−/− double mutant exhibits phenotype of shorter roots, semi-dwarfism, and early senescence, in addition to increase in susceptibility to host-adapted virulent powdery fungus Golovinomyces orontii infection, when compared to wild type.\n\nA research focused on interactome of Qa-SNARE proteins in Arabidopsis reported a number of new interactions between specific SNARE proteins and numerous proteins of diverse functions, including novel proteins with unknown functions. One such interaction was found between SYP43 and an uncharacterized protein, which we decided to name AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) due to the similarity to glycosyltransferases in its amino acid sequence.\n\nGlycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large family of enzymes, characterized by their ability to transfer sugar moieties to a specific acceptor substrate creating a glycosidic bond. GTs are known to produce a variety of glycoproteins and small sugar-containing molecules with diverse biological roles, but in plants, these enzymes are especially important for processing products of photosynthesis and for biosynthesis of cell-wall. At present, 567 Arabidopsis proteins recorded in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme Database (CAZy) (; http://www.cazy.org/e1.html, accessed Nov 1, 2023) with ‘GlycosylTransferase’ annotation have been further classified into 45 of 117 GT families known today (including GT0 or GTnc, ‘non-classified’). Independently from the sequence-based classification implemented in CAZy database, GTs can also be categorized according to the type of sugar they use as a substrate. One such example is the superfamily of fucosyltransferases (FUTs), which utilize guanidine 5′-diphosphate-β-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as a substrate. In plants, macromolecules known to incorporate fucose in their structures are N-glycans, O-fucosylated proteins, as well as components of cell walls, such as xyloglucans, arabinogalactan proteins and pectic polysaccharides—rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II). Based on characteristics of FUTs that have been identified thus far (a majority of which are putative fucosyltransferases), it has been established that fucose is attached to each of these types of macromolecules by a specific FUT(s). As our knowledge about plant FUTs is still lacking, the full scope of their biological functions is, at present, not fully understood.\n\nIn the present study, we observed subcellular localization of AtGTLP by cross-pollinating a transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP construct with organelle marker lines, as the first step to investigate the functions of AtGTLP.",
  "methods": "Materials and methods\n\nPlant material and growth conditions\n\nFor colocalization observations, Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chamber, in 22°C in long-day light (16 h/8 h, L/D) conditions on MS medium w/vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie), containing 0.3% gellan gum (Wako) and 2% sucrose. pH was adjusted to 6.265. Fluorescence was observed in cells in the elongation zone of roots of 5-day-old seedlings.\n\nFor analysis of mutant phenotype, two T-DNA insertion lines SALK_025999 (atgtlp-1) and SALK_011654 (atgtlp-2) were used. Columbia-0 accession plants were used as a control. Growth conditions and medium were the same as for colocalization analysis. For statistical analysis of primary root length and fresh mass, 25 individuals (11-day-old) were used for each genotype.\n\nRNA extraction and RT-PCR\n\nRNA was extracted from 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedling with RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). 100 mg of fresh tissue was used for each sample. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific). 5 µg of the extracted RNA was added to each reaction as a template. The presence or lack of AtGTLP expression in mutant lines was confirmed by PCR reaction using ExTaq polymerase (Takara). 1 µg of cDNA was used as a template. Primers used for RT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nGene cloning\n\nA 5.1 kbp fragment of nucleotide sequence comprising of the native promoter and AtGTLP (At2g04280) gene sequence flanked by 5′ and 3′ UTRs was amplified using PrimeSTAR® GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara). The amplified sequence was subsequently subcloned into a pENTR™ vector using pENTR™/D-TOPO Vector Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) for directional cloning. The vector was used to transform One Shot™ TOP10 Chemically Competent Escherichia coli (ThermoFisher Scientific).\n\nTransformants were selected on solid LB medium with kanamycin 50 mg l−1 and cultured overnight in liquid LB with the same antibiotic concentration. Isolated plasmid was linearized and fused with monomeric GFP (mGFP) gene sequence using In-Fusion HD Kit (Takara). Product of this reaction was used to transform competent E. coli cells and the transformants selection procedure was repeated. Isolated plasmid was used as the entry clone for pHGW vector as the destination vector in Gateway™ LR Clonase™ II reaction (ThermoFisher Scientific). AtGTLP-mGFP in pHGW construct was transformed into competent E. coli cells and transformant colonies were selected on solid LB medium with 100 mg l−1 spectinomycin.\n\nFor creation of mRFP-GOS12 Golgi marker line, translational fusion between mRFP and GOS12 were generated by inserting cDNA encoding mRFP in front of the start codon of GOS12 genomic sequence including 1.9 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence and 1.2 kb of the 3′-flanking sequence in pENTR™ vector using In-Fusion HD Kit. The resulted mRFP-GOS12 construct was subcloned into pGWB1 by LR Clonase™ II.\n\nPrimers used for gene cloning and linearization are listed in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nGeneration of Arabidopsis transformants\n\nCol-0 plants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformed with the prepared plasmid containing the AtGTLP-mGFP construct using flower dip method. Collected seeds were sown on MS medium with 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar with 25 mg l−1 of hygromycin and 250 mg l−1 of claforan.\n\nSelection of T1 lines with a single AtGTLP-mGFP construct was conducted by sowing T2 seeds on selective MS medium with hygromycin. Lines, for which we observed 3 : 1 segregation ratio of resistant to non-resistant plants, were selected as single-insertion lines.\n\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy observations\n\nFor subcellular localization observations of AtGTLP protein, AtGTLP-mGFP single-insertion lines were cross-pollinated with organelle markers lines. mRFP-VAMP721 and tagRFP-VAMP727 lines were used as markers for transport vesicle from the TGN to the cell plate/plasma membrane or to the vacuole, respectively. mRFP-SYP61, mRFP-SYP43, and VHAa1-mRFP lines were used as TGN markers. ST-mRFP was used as a trans-Golgi marker and mRFP-GOS12 as a Golgi marker (in this study).\n\nColocalization observations were conducted using Zeiss LSM980 with Airyscan 2 confocal laser scanning microscope system equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 immersion objective. Excitation laser wavelengths of 488 nm and 543 nm were used. Pinhole was set to 1AU.\n\nColocalization analysis\n\nThe degree of colocalization of each organelle marker with AtGTLP-mGFP was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). To obtain PCC values, Coloc 2 plugin for Fiji/ImageJ software was used. For each organelle marker, three 50 µm×50 µm images with 15 randomly selected regions of interest (ROIs), freehand-drawn around the observed dot-like structures, were used for analysis (45 ROIs total for each marker). Noise in the images was corrected using the ‘Smooth’ function of Fiji/ImageJ. Line fluorescence intensity plots were generated using RGB profiler plugin for Fiji/ImageJ.",
  "results": "Results\n\nAtGTLP is a putative glycosyltransferase\n\nAtGTLP is predicted to be a membrane-anchored protein comprising of 568 residues. DeepTMHMM (; https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM, accessed Nov 1, 2023) transmembrane topology prediction model for this protein indicates a presence of a single transmembrane helix near the N-terminus of AtGTLP protein (residues 24–44). The short N-terminal tail of the protein was predicted to localize on the cytosolic side of an organelle membrane, while residues 45–568 reside inside the lumen (Figure 1A). AlphaFold2 model of AtGTLP’s three-dimensional structure includes a globular domain of unknown function in the C-terminal part of the amino acid sequence (Figure 1B). The C-terminal part of the amino-acid sequence was modelled with high confidence, while N-terminal part had a lower reliability score (Figure 1C–E).\n\nAnalysis of AtGTLP’s amino acid sequence using Phyre2 server (; http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index, accessed Nov 1, 2023) suggests a distant homology between the C-terminal domain of AtGTLP and human protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2; 19% of sequence identity, 99.2% confidence), protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1; 16% i.d., 98.9% confidence), as well as C. elegans protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (CePOFUT2; 20% i.d., 98.9% confidence) and protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (CePOFUT1; 18% i.d., 99.2% confidence). Superposition between AlphaFold2 model of C-terminal domain of AtGTLP and the top ranked template (human POFUT2; PDB ID: 4AP6, A chain) is shown in Figure 1F. Interestingly, among top ranked templates, we observed no plant GTs nor other types of plant enzymes. Moreover, although the Conserved Domain Database (; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, accessed Nov 1, 2023) recognizes the presence of ‘O-FUT-like’ domain in the C-terminal region of AtGTLP, when its amino acid sequence was used as a query in BLAST search against Arabidopsis proteome, none of the 38 proteins that have been characterized as members of Arabidopsis FUT family in literature were present among the results. No other motif that could suggest possible functions of AtGTLP has been found to be present in its amino acid sequence. In the CAZy database, AtGTLP is currently classified as ‘GTnc’.\n\nAtGTLP is localized mainly on the trans-Golgi\n\nTo investigate the subcellular localization of AtGTLP, we established transgenic Arabidopsis expressing mGFP-tagged AtGTLP (AtGTLP-mGFP) under the control of native promoter. The fluorescence of AtGTLP-mGFP protein concentrated in dot- or ring-like structures scattered within the cell (Figure 2).\n\nIn order to reveal which organelle those structures correspond to, we established double-visualization Arabidopsis lines expressing AtGTLP-mGFP with various RFP-tagged organelle markers. Among tested markers, the extent of colocalization of AtGTLP with trans-Golgi marker, ST was the highest and relatively consistent among all analyzed ROIs (Figure 3; PCC=0.5–0.91; median=0.75), suggesting that a significant population of AtGTLP localizes to trans-Golgi. Visual observations of colocalization of these two proteins show that while both seem to often localize to the same disk-like structures, patches of magenta-only and green-only fluorescence within those structures were also visible (Figure 2A, ‘close-up’). Based on this characteristic, we suspect that within trans-Golgi, AtGTLP segregates to specific zones only. As expected, relatively high PCCs were obtained also when colocalization with GOS12, a Golgi marker (Figure 2B), was analyzed (Figure 3; 0.21–0.83, median=0.58). However, whereas for the AtGTLP-mGFP/ST-mRFP pair, the two peaks representing GFP and RFP in side-view line fluorescence profile of a single disk-like structure overlap almost entirely (Figure 4A), for the AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-GOS12 pair a slight shift between those two peaks was observed (Figure 4B).\n\nMoreover, we found that in some of the analyzed ROIs, AtGTLP partially colocalizes with TGN markers, SYP61 (Figure 2C) and VHAa1 (Figure 2D), whereas in other ROIs, PCC was close to zero (Figure 3; PCC=0.0–0.65; median=0.41 and PCC=−0.01–0.79; median=0.46, respectively). Side-view line fluorescence profiles for these two markers show a similar shift between the GFP and RFP peaks (Figure 4C, D). Interestingly, for the third analyzed TGN marker used in this study, SYP43, we observed that areas where the two colors of florescence overlap with each other, were scarcer (Figure 2E). Relatively low degree of colocalization for AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-SYP43 pair was also reflected in lower PCC values (Figure 3; −0.17–0.64, with median of 0.26) and line fluorescence profile, which suggest that SYP43 localizes to the center of AtGTLP rings (Figure 4E).\n\nTaking into consideration the possibility that AtGTLP is transported within the cell as a cargo, two transport pathway markers—VAMP721, a marker of transport from the TGN to the cell plate and the plasma membrane, as well as VAMP727, a marker of vacuolar transport —were also included in the study. In case of VAMP721, we observed very little overlap of GFP and RFP fluorescence (Figure 2F, Figure 4F), and low PCCs (Figure 3; −0.48–0.48, median=0.15), whereas colocalization between AtGTLP and VAMP727, similarly to SYP61 and VHAa1, was inconsistent across the analyzed ROIs (Figure 2G, Figure 3; PCC=0.01–0.7, median=0.42). Line fluorescence profiles for AtGTLP-GFP/tagRFP-VAMP727 pair also show a pattern similar to AtGTLP-GFP/mRFP-SYP61 pair (Figure 4G). When inspecting the degree of colocalization visually, we observed that the areas of overlapping fluorescence were present mainly within clusters of dot- or ring-like structures, which most likely correspond to Golgi/TGN. In addition to these clusters, ‘free’ dots of tagRFP-VAMP727 signal, where AtGTLP-mGFP was absent, could also be observed (Figure 2G, arrowheads).\n\natgtlp mutants exhibit no obvious phenotypes\n\nAccording to data available in eFP Browser (Klepikova Arabidopsis Atlas), AtGTLP is expressed in most parts of a plant, including roots and young leaves, with the exception of dry seeds.\n\nIn both mutant lines used in this study, T-DNA insertion was confirmed to be present inside AtGTLP’s exon (Figure 5A). Although the results of RT-PCR confirmed that transcription of AtGTLP in both of the T-DNA lines is absent or reduced to levels undetectable with this method (Figure 5B), growth of mutant plants was comparable to wild type plants, and we could not observe any distinctive phenotype differences between atgtlp-1 or atgtlp-2 single mutants and wild-type plants in 8-day-old and 11-day-old seedlings (Figure 5C, D).",
