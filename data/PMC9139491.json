  "title": "Spaceflight-Associated Vascular Remodeling and Gene Expression in Mouse Calvaria",
  "abstract": "Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and pro-osteogenic gene (BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nGravity-dependent retrograde blood flow to upper non-load bearing regions and blood pooling in the brain are linked to increased facial edema, cerebral venous pressure, intracranial blood volume, intracranial cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF) and stroke volume. In addition, altered cerebral hemodynamics account for neurological symptoms common in astronauts that include visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome, post-flight headaches, syncope, dizziness, and impaired cognitive abilities. The skull is in close proximity to cerebral vessels impacted by microgravity and acts as a stress absorber. Although several spaceflight studies have examined the effects of prolonged shifts in hydrostatic gradients in the load-bearing, lower regions of the body, few studies have examined vascular structural modifications and gene expression in skull bone, also known as calvaria. Calvarial syndesmotic sutures are active regions of growth, movement, and repair. During development, vascularization precedes early osteogenesis on the thin plate of the skull and is followed by the formation of a plate caudal to the first. In addition, resident stem cells or osteoprogenitor cells in the suture mesenchyme contribute to the repair of stressed or fractured calvarial bones by secreting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and recruiting blood vessels and chondroclasts. In pathological condition or synostosis, the sutures close prematurely resulting in skeletal malformations seen in genetic disorders. Clinically, in children with a small skull base, abnormal calvarial growth and cerebral perfusion increases intracranial pressure (ICP), a trend seen in astronauts. 30 days of spaceflight have been shown to exacerbate these processes, where an elevation of brain arterial flow increases stiffness, myogenic vasoconstriction, and maximal diameter of the cerebral arteries as mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ mechanisms. Our previous work showed a 30% increase in calvarial bone mineral density in mice after 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 flight.However, there are few reports on bone vascular adaptations to microgravity at a multi-scale level.\n\nBased on the state-of-the-research, we propose that calvarial bone and vascular remodeling occurs in response to skeletal unloading, cephalad fluid shifts, and elimination of gravity-oriented hydrostatic gradients. However, the exact adaptation of calvarial vasculature to cephalad fluid shifts is not yet fully characterized. In this line of inquiry, we examine the adaptations in vascular morphology, capillarization, and osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression in mouse calvaria exposed to microgravity using image morphometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We also provide a comprehensive protocol for the isolation of RNA from thick skull bone tissue in quantities sufficient for determining calvarial angiogenesis and osteogenesis-associated gene responses.",
  "methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nExperiments were performed on two groups of mice, one flown on NASA’s STS-131 flight for 15 days and the other on the BION-M1 flight for 30 days, and each spaceflight (SF) cohort was associated with a terrestrial ground control (GC). The time scale from loading the mice on Earth, landing, distribution of tissue and calvarial measurements for mice from both flights are illustrated in Figure 1 (Panels A and B). The study was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of the Russian Federation State Research Center Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) as well as the IACUCs of Moscow State University and NASA. The experimental protocols were conducted in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) veterinarians certified all STS-131 mice as healthy prior to flight, while BION-M1 mice were purchased from the Animal Breeding Facility Branch of Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry.\n\nAnimals\n\nSTS-131 Flight\n\nThe STS-131 flight included eight C57BL/6 female mice (16–23 week-old; Charles River, Raleigh, NC, United States). Age-matched GC mice were housed in a 12-h light-dark cycle in an Animal Enclosure Modules situated in Discovery’s middeck and provided with pre-adapted food and water ad libitum. All the mice were weighed before cage loading and again after cage unloading before euthanizing the mice on the ground. After 15 days, STS-131 returned to NASA-KSC and SF mice were distributed to multiple investigators, euthanized, and tissues harvested within 3–4 h. The Biospecimen Sharing Project (BSP), enabled mice tissue sharing among different investigators from different campuses.\n\nBION-M1 Flight\n\nOf the eleven, 19–20 week-old male wild-type, pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice, five were flown on the BION-M1 biosatellite. The remaining five mice comprising the GC were maintained terrestrially. Both SF and GC groups were housed under identical conditions in Russian Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya (BOS) habitats on a 12-h light-dark cycle in identical environmental conditions and consumed a paste food diet containing 74.6% H2O developed by Russia’s IBMP. SF mice were loaded onto the unmanned BION-M1 biosatellite and launched on 19 April 2013 on a Soyuz 2-1a rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome and returned on 19 May 2013 in the Orenburg region of Russia. The BOS habitats were then used to house the GC mice. 13–15 h after return to Earth, study subjects were transported to Moscow, Russia and euthanized. Investigators from University of California, San Diego (UCSD) dissected the calvaria and prepared samples for transport either in RNA later (for quantitative real time PCR analysis) or frozen at −80°C (for lectin staining). The exact details of the BION-M1 experiment is thoroughly reviewed elsewhere.\n\nFenestrae Measurements From Micro-computed Tomography of the Mice Calvaria\n\nThe diameter of the skull fenestra were measured from microCT images obtained previously by. The detailed protocol for the preparation of the BION-M1 mice calvaria, volume of interest and the plane used for microCT imaging is provided elsewhere. Briefly, calvariae were moistened with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and wrapped in tissue paper and scanned with a 9 μm voxel size, an electrical potential of 50 kVp and current of 200 μA, and a 0.5 mm aluminum filter. The parietal section of the calvarial structure flanked rostrally by two frontal bones and caudally by a single bone were imaged on micro-computed tomography scanner, Skyscan 1076 (Bruker μCT, Kontich, Belgium) according to the established guidelines. A volume of interest (VOI) in the centre of the parietal sections measuring 18 mm3, 5.5 mm × 1.2 mm area in the coronal plane, 2.7 mm depth was imaged. The centre was identified by the anterior lamboid and coronal sutures intersection. Histomorphetric measurements of bone structure and thickness was determined SkyScan CT-analyser and DataViewer software. The diameter of the fenestrae on either sides of central sutures were examined qualitatively by drawing a white dotted line around each fenestrae and determining the diameter across the fenestrae.\n\nHematoxylin and Eosin Staining\n\nThe BION-M1 calvarial samples were extracted from the sacrificed mice after touchdown and transported to the laboratory in 10% formalin. The tissue was then decalcified with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution for 4 weeks. The tissues were dehydrated with graded series of ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections were made along the suture region with a thickness of 7 μM and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n\nLectin Staining of the Calvaria\n\nThe calvarial sections from the BION-M1 mice were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS and washed three times with PBS. The sections were then permeabilized in PBT (PBS, 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated with FITC-conjugated BS1-B4 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 4 C overnight. The tissue sections were then mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). The parietal cross sections were 7 μm thick and sectioned as duplicates on a single slide. The negative controls were sections without FITC-conjugated BSI-B4. The parasagittal vessels were counted manually and diameter measured throughout the calvarial section (30–38 fields/slide, n = 9 animals for STS-131 and n = 10 animals for BION-M1) by a random-blinded observer in a random manner using the free hand tool of ImageJ software. The pictures were taken with a 40x magnification using a Olympus B×51 FL microscope.\n\nQuantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR)\n\nThe frontal and parietal portion of 5 GC mice and five S F mice from the BION-M1 flight were dissected and stored in RNA post-flight. The broad parietal section (both the bones) of the calvarial tissue samples were then powdered in a homogenizer and transferred to Eppendorf tubes filled with Trizol®, after which samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and prevented from thawing. Following arrival at the distributed laboratories, samples were thawed and treated in Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc.) for 30 min to completely disassociate the nucleoprotein complex. After 30 min, the samples were pipetted about 20 times and kept at room temperature (RT) for 2 min 200μL of chloroform was added to Trizol® and agitated for 15 s by hand. The samples were kept at RT for another 2 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min to facilitate phase separation. The aqueous phase was then transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing an equal volume of 70% ethanol. After the total RNA was precipitated, the solution was transferred to an RNA-binding column and RNA purification was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Purelink RNA, Life technologies). The pure RNA was eluted from the columns in 30 μL of RNase-free water, and the RNA concentration and purity was estimated using nanodrop. Normalized RNA (1 mg/ml) was converted into cDNA using a Qiagen kit with a gDNA wipeout buffer. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42°C for 30 min per manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting cDNA was stored at −20°C or used immediately. The gene expression analysis was carried out using SYBR green (2x QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR, Qiagen) in a 96-well format on an Eppendorf Mastercycler. Primer sequences used for real time PCR are listed in Table 1 and sourced from IDT Technologies. The annealing temperature was standardized at 57°C for 15 s except RUNX2 and OCN for which the annealing temperature was 58°C for 15 s. The results were normalized with 18s RNA and GAPDH housekeeping genes; the experiment was run in triplicates and Livak’s method was used to calculate the difference in expression between SF and GC mice.\n\nStatistics\n\nGene expression data from quantitative PCR experiments are expressed as a fold difference of the Ct values from housekeeping genes 18s RNA and GAPDH. Differences in gene expression, the number of capillaries, and vessel diameter between SF and GC groups were compared in GraphPad Prism five software using Student’s unpaired t-test. In the absence of a normal distribution, we used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney u-test to determine the significance, for which*p < 0.05 was considered significant. All values are mean ± SD and n is the number of animals per group.",
  "results": "Results\n\nChanges in Vascular Morphology in Mouse Calvaria after 15 and 30 days of Spaceflight\n\nOur previous µCT analysis on STS-131 S F calvaria show that 15 days of spaceflight results in a 30% increase in bone volume in spaceflight mice calvaria compared to control mice. However, 30 days of spaceflight in BION-M1 did not show remarkable differences in bone volume and thickness. To determine the spaceflight associated vascular effects in mice calvaria, we first qualitatively compared the size of the parietal fenestrae of BION-M1 previously occupied by the vessels from the BION-M1 µCT micrographs. The bone thickness and bone volume of BION-M1 mice calvarial sections are published elsewhere. The scanned µCT micrographs of calvarial sections from GC and SF mice showed decreases in the size of fenestrae around the parietal sutures apart from the appearance of increases in cross-sectional thickness in the representative SF group compared to GC group (Figure 2A, Panels A and B).\n\nFurther qualitative histological examination of the bone trabeculae along the suture showed a number of foci, nucleus and empty spaces left by dead cells in the suture region and the bone plates (Figure 2A, Panel C and D). Next, we quantified parasagittal vessel structural and molecular vascular adaptations to 15-day and 30-day spaceflight by immunostaining capillaries in the sagittal suture section of the mice calvaria with, Griffonia simplicifolia lectin isolectin-B4 as a fluorescent endothelial cell marker (Figure 2A, Panels E and F). Manual, double-blinded quantification of Lectin B4-stained parasagittal vessels of the mice calvaria showed a significant increase in vessel numbers in SF mice compared to GC in the STS- 131 mice cohort (GC: 6 ± 2 vessels/mm2, SF: 10 ± 6 vessels/mm2; n = 4, *p = 0.054, t-test and Mann-Whitney u-test) (Figure 2B). The vessel diameters in bone trabeculae are reduced 4-fold in SF compared to GC in STS-131 tissues (15–20 images, two sections/slide, *p = 0.02) (Figure 2A, Panel C). In BION-M1 mice calvaria, there were no significant differences in the diameter or the number of vessels between GC and SF mice (GC: 20 ± 14 vessels/mm2, SF: 16 ± 8 vessels/mm2; n = 5, *p > 0.05, t-test and Mann-Whitney u-test) (Figure 2C). Capillarization is increased and diameter of the vessel is decreased in the STS-131 S F population while no significant change in the vessel numbers or diameter occurs in BION-M1 SF mice.\n\nMicrogravity-Associated Alterations in Calvaria Gene Expression Related to Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis\n\nTo determine the effects of cephalad fluid shifts on calvarial angiogenesis and osteogenesis associated gene expression, VEGFA, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), BMP-2, dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), RUNX2 and OCN were examined using qPCR in central parietal section of calvaria samples from GC and BION-M1 SF mice. Pro-angiogenic VEGFA expression increases 15 folds in SF compared to GC mice (Figure 3, Panel A). Concomitantly, BMP-2 gene expression increases 11 fold in SF compared to GC (Figure 3, Panel C). RUNX2, required for osteoblast differentiation, also increases 2-fold in SF mice compared to GC (Figure 3, Panel D). DMP1 is involved in the regulation of bone formation and is upregulated in SF mice (Figure 3, Panel F). OCN remained unchanged in GC and SF mice. The material was insufficient to analyze SOST expression, involved in anabolic activity of bone. In sum, both angiogenic and osteogenic genes in the calvaria are upregulated in response to spaceflight-related fluid shifts.",
