  "title": "Conserved plant transcriptional responses to microgravity from two consecutive spaceflight experiments",
  "abstract": "Introduction\n\nUnderstanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions. Several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. However, there is limited overlap between results from different experiments. Differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difficult to find a consistent response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of microgravity from other spaceflight effects.\n\nMethods\n\nPlant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1 g control.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nAn RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR revealed a significant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity between the two experiments. Relative to onboard 1 g controls, genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca++ signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1 g and microgravity (μ g) shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) which were upregulated in microgravity, while several of their corresponding target genes were found to be downregulated in microgravity. Interestingly, the downregulated target genes are enriched in those encoding chloroplast-localized enzymes and proteins. These results uncover microgravity unique transcriptional changes and highlight the validity and importance of an onboard 1 g control.",
  "introduction": "Introduction\n\nAs an essential part of life support systems for long-duration space missions, plants supplement food as well as purify the air and water. Future colonization efforts will require the ability to grow plants in unfamiliar environments. However, the space environment poses challenges to growing plants. In addition to the difficulties of providing essential requirements for plant growth (light, water, nutrients, etc.), growing plants in space requires the mitigation of unfavorable factors such as altered gas composition, lack of convective currents, and cosmic radiation.\n\nIt is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate plant adaptations to space. Toward that goal, several spaceflight experiments have examined the global transcriptional changes of plants grown on the International Space Station (ISS). One caveat to these studies is that until recently, lighted habitats for plant experimentation were limited; for ease of handling and setup, several experiments were carried out in Biological Research In Canisters hardware (BRICs), where plants were grown in the dark. Another point of concern is that many spaceflight experiments have employed hardware-matched experiments on Earth as controls; however, it is difficult to replicate all of the stresses that plants may face on the ISS on the ground.\n\nFurther, while several transcriptional datasets have been generated (accessible through the NASA GeneLab data repository), differences in plant age, tissue type, and growth conditions confound efforts to separate primary responses to microgravity from other spaceflight related stress responses. A recent meta-analysis by Barker et al. clearly illustrates some of these confounding effects. The authors showed that the analysis method (RNA-Seq vs. microarrays) was a principal factor leading to variability between datasets as was the hardware utilized for the spaceflight experiments. Nevertheless, focusing only on experiments conducted in BRIC hardware helped uncover common responses. Namely, oxidative stress, heat shock, cell wall dynamics, hypoxia, and ROS signaling were Gene Ontology annotations enriched in spaceflight compared to ground controls. A transcriptional profiling study of 12 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware found organ-specific gene expression changes between leaves, hypocotyls, and roots. Although each tissue exhibited unique responses, cell wall remodeling, touch response, and pathogen responses were common themes among the genes differentially expressed in space.\n\nPlant growth is highly responsive to external cues. Two critical cues –light and gravity– have profound influences on the direction and magnitude of plant growth. Plant roots grow down with the gravity vector (positive gravitropism), while the stems grow opposite to the gravity vector (negative gravitropism) and toward light (positive phototropism). On earth, light and gravity work in combination to direct the orientation of the primary axes of growth as well as root and shoot branching and leaf angle, enabling efficient nutrient acquisition and light capture. The relative contribution of each of these cues in regulating plant growth is difficult to disentangle on Earth, where gravity is a constant; the ISS provides an ideal platform to answer such fundamental questions.\n\nThe European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was one of the controlled environment plant growth habitats operational on the ISS for many years. In addition to providing lighting, regulated air circulation, and ethylene scrubbing, the EMCS was unique in that it consisted of two centrifuge rotors within a growth chamber. Rotor speeds could be varied to impart g levels ranging from 0 - 2 g. The EMCS, therefore, afforded researchers the ability to conduct a simultaneous 1 g control in space as well as to specifically query the effects of partial gravity.\n\nSpaceflight experiments utilizing EMCS hardware have attempted to uncouple light and gravity stimuli. Some experiments have examined the transcriptional response of plants to partial g levels. We previously reported that a subset of genes differentially expressed in microgravity respond to incremental increases in g levels. Other researchers have compared differences in gene expression between Lunar or Martian gravity and onboard 1 g controls. These types of experiments can inform us on plant responses to extraterrestrial habitats and will be important for aiding with long term colonization efforts.\n\nIn this study, we compare the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis shoots from two independent spaceflight experiments conducted on the ISS. In both experiments, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 5-6 days in the EMCS. The results revealed considerable overlap between the two experiments despite differences in the experimental setup. Furthermore, onboard 1 g controls facilitated the identification of microgravity-specific differences in gene expression.",
  "methods": "Materials and methods\n\nPreflight ground testing\n\nPrior to flight build, optimization was carried out at North Carolina State University with a focus on seed stock viability, experimental protocols, and downstream sample recovery and processing. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seed stocks were carefully screened to obtain an average germination of ≥99%, and dissection and processing protocols were developed to recover ≥1μg RNA from ≤3mg input tissue with a high degree of RNA integrity. Seed storage tests were carried out to ensure the viability of sterilized seeds for at least a 6 month period. Preflight testing for Plant Signaling (PS) included a Schedule Test and Operations Verification Test (OVT) at the Norwegian User Support and Operations Center (N-USOC, Trondheim, Norway), in an Engineering Reference Module (ERM-1). Similarly, ahead of the Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) spaceflight, an Experiment Verification Test (EVT) at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) in an EMCS ground facility (ERM-2), and an Operations Verification Test (OVT) in the EMCS Engineering Reference Module (ERM-1) at N-USOC were carried out. All preflight and flight preparations for seed, media, and hardware assembly were carried out at NASA ARC.\n\nFlight experiment preparation\n\nPS and PRR were carried out in the EMCS using the experimental unique equipment (EUE)s which are the TROPI-like seed cassettes previously described. Whatman #3 blotter paper and black-gridded PES membrane (PALL life Sciences Cat. No. 65561) were cut to fit the seed cassettes. Blotter papers were pre-soaked in 0.5X MS media, pH 5.7 (without sucrose) and allowed to dry. Blotter papers and membranes were sterilized by autoclaving. Seeds were surface sterilized and allowed to dry for 2 hours. Healthy viable seeds were selected under a dissecting microscope and attached to the gridded membrane using guar gum. Seeds were positioned with micropyles pointing down (away from lights) with 27 seeds/membrane. Gridded seeded membranes were attached to prepared blotters with guar gum and fixed to cassette base plates. Cassette covers were installed and sealed with foil tape (3M). A total of 80 cassettes were prepared for each experiment. Seed cassettes were assembled for flight at NASA ARC and loaded into experimental containers (ECs) approximately 4 weeks prior to the scheduled flight.\n\nSpaceflight\n\nOnboard the ISS, ECs were loaded into the EMCS by the attending astronaut. Each EC contained 5 seed cassettes for a total of 4 ECs (20 seed cassettes)/centrifuge rotor. Experiments were initiated by hydration, controlled remotely. The experimental timelines for PS and PRR are shown in  Figure 1 . Both experiments were illuminated by white LEDs along the shoot side of the cassettes, and both experiments consisted of two replicate experimental runs. PS was carried out under continuous light, while PRR employed a long-day light regime (16h light/8h dark). Images were obtained from cameras located within the EMCS chamber. EMCS environmental parameters for PS were set at 21% O2 and a constant seedling temperature of 24°C. For PS, the ambient cabin air was purged from the EMCS chamber prior to each experimental run so that CO2 levels gradually increased to equilibrate with the cabin (beginning ~370 ppm and equilibrating to ~760 ppm). EMCS environmental parameters for PRR were set at 21% O2, 24°C daytime seedling temperature, and 21°C nighttime seedling temperature. Due to constraints with the upmass of air gas canisters, the EMCS chamber was not purged prior to each run of PRR; chamber CO2 for the duration of PRR was similar to the ISS cabin (~3000 ppm). In both PS and PRR, environmental factors were monitored by real-time telemetry to record O2, CO2, seedling temperature, and relative humidity. At the end of the experiments, seed cassettes were removed from the ECs, with 1 g cassettes handled first, and frozen immediately in the onboard -80°C freezer (MELFI). Seed cassettes remained frozen onboard the ISS. Samples were maintained at cryogenic temperature during return via Space-X Dragon, after splashdown, and until delivery to the laboratory. Samples were then stored at -80°C until processing for RNA.\n\nGround reference controls\n\nFor both PS and PRR, ground reference experiments were carried out in the ERM-2 at NASA-ARC, using flight build spares and matching environmental parameters to the flight experiments. Briefly, this hardware was designed to replicate environmental conditions experienced aboard the ISS to include temperature, gas composition, and provide comparable support to the flight hardware. Experimental containers (ECs) were positioned in the ERM in an upright position such that seedlings grew vertically, with lighting provided within each seed cassette from above the germinating seedlings, similar to the flight configuration.\n\nRNA isolation\n\nAll analyzed shoot samples for the 1 g controls were from seed cassettes in position 3 of each EC. For PS, position 3 corresponded to 0.76 g and for PRR position 3 corresponded to 1 g ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). For each RNA isolation, seed cassettes were processed singly as follows. A single seed cassette was retrieved from the freezer, and the cover was removed. The cassette base was placed on a chilled platform, and RNA-later (Thermo Fisher Cat. No. AM7021) was added. The seedlings were dissected into root and shoot fractions and stored at 4°C in RNA-later for 24 hours, followed by storage at -20°C until RNA isolation. RNA was isolated from each shoot sample using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Applied Biosystems Cat No. AM1931). RNA recovery and integrity were monitored by Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100). For the PRR shoot samples, the RNA isolation protocol was modified in order to retain the small RNA fraction as well.\n\nIllumina sequencing\n\nEach sample for Illumina Sequencing consisted of RNA isolated from a single seed cassette (each containing 27 seedlings) and each treatment/condition consisted of 3-4 replicates each. PS library preparation and sequencing were carried out by the Genomic Sciences Laboratory at North Carolina State University (Raleigh, NC) as described previously. Libraries were prepared using the ultra-directional library prep kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Sequencing was carried out on 3 lanes of Illumina HiSeq2500 (125 bp single end reads). For PRR, Library preparation and Illumina sequencing for RNA and small RNA (sRNA) was carried out by Novogene Corporation Inc. (Sacramento, CA).\n\nData processing and analysis\n\nRaw reads were cleaned up to remove adapters and reads shorter than 50 reads by cutadapt. Quality control was evaluated by FastQC to ensure adapters were removed. Reads were aligned using HiSat2 to the Arabidopsis genome using TAIR10 and Araport11 genome annotations (downloaded 08/2018). Read counts per feature were generated using HTseq-Count. Differential gene expression was determined using DESeq2. Features with one count or less in any sample were discarded. Differentially expressed genes were filtered on p-values. For the individual analyses of PS and PRR, the significance cutoff was padj <0.05 and for the combined analyses, the cutoff was padj < 0.01. Each sample and condition was represented by 3-4 replicates. Normalized DESeq2 counts tables were visualized as heatmaps using the R package pheatmap (version 1.0.12), clustering by column and scaling by row.\n\nTo determine whether overlap between individually analyzed PS and PRR DE gene lists were significant and non-random, hypergeometric distribution hypothesis testing was carried out using the phyper function of the R programming language. These analyses assumed a total genome size of 33,603 genes. Similarly, enrichment for HY5 targets in µ g DEG lists obtained from the combined PS/PRR dataset was analyzed by the same function, assuming 3,894 putative HY5 binding targets within the genome.\n\nTo identify potential upstream regulatory sequences present in the DEGs, a 4th order Markov background model was constructed using the 1kb regions of DNA upstream of all genes found to be differentially regulated in µ g. Using this model as a background control, MEME analysis examined the 500 bp regions upstream of upregulated genes using the parameters “-mod anr -minw 6 -maxw 8 -p 4 -nmotifs 10 -dna -revcomp” to elicit enriched motifs.\n\nGene Ontology (GO) annotation and enrichment was queried using agriGO2, ExPath2.0, PANTHER18.0, and PlantGSAD.\n\nPCA variance analysis was performed using variance stabilized counts from the DESeq dds object in ggplot2; this was limited to the top five hundred transcripts ranked by variance. Data was captured from the plotPCA function using ggplot_build. To determine the significance of the correlation between the variables of Age and Gravity Condition and the principal components, we used the package PCAtools R package. The function eigencorplot was used to visualize and test the significance of the correlation between these two variables and the top six principal components ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). The comparison was made using Pearson’s correlation, with pairwise.complete.obs, so that the correlation between each pair is evaluated using all paired data for each variable. The Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction was applied.\n\nData availability\n\nRaw sequence files and metadata for PS and PRR are available at the NASA data repository GeneLab under the accession numbers OSD-223 and OSD-437.",
  "results": "Results\n\nExperimental setup and growth parameters\n\nTo minimize the impact of handling and transport, seeds were dry-mounted on membranes and remained dormant until hydration at the initiation of each experimental run. The dry seed configuration with an on-orbit hydration also eliminated the need for late loading and allowed for flexibility in the event of flight scrubbing or delayed experiment initiation. Following hydration and illumination, seedlings from PS and PRR germinated with high frequency ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and exhibited nominal growth across each run of both experiments. Differences in experimental design ( Figure 1 ) included the presence/absence of a day/night cycle, total experiment length, and centrifugal profiles. Notably, PS incorporated 48 hours of initial 1 g treatment at the start of the experiment. For the later experiment, PRR, the μ g rotor remained stationary for the entire duration of the experiment. A morphological difference was observed between these experiments, characterized by a largely uniform orientation of seedling roots in PS, in contrast to the more disordered growth patterns observed in PRR ( Figure 2 ). This difference could be due to the initial gravitational cue provided to all seedlings in PS, the presence of a day/night cycle in PRR, or a combination of the two. Despite a small degree of variation from seed cassette to seed cassette, each experiment provided a sufficient amount of healthy plant tissue for downstream analysis, and only those cassettes which exhibited nominal growth and development were selected for downstream analysis ( Supplementary Figure 3 ).\n\nDifferentially expressed genes\n\nThe individual DE-Seq2 analyses of PS and PRR yielded a significant number of genes that were differentially expressed between microgravity (μ g) and the onboard (1 g) control. In total, we identified 1,819 and 1,792 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PS, and PRR, respectively. The overlap between the two experiments for both μ g upregulated and μ g downregulated DEG lists was significant ( Table 1 ). Both experiments shared 178 genes upregulated in µ g and 399 genes downregulated in µ g. GO annotation revealed enrichment of the GO terms, “Regulation of Transcription” and “Auxin Signaling” in the common µ g upregulated genes. “Cell Wall” and “Response to Stress” were GO terms enriched in the common µ g downregulated genes.\n\nTo further compare the two experiments, RNA-Seq reads from PS and PRR were re-analyzed in a combined study to impart increased statistical power. DE-Seq2 analysis of this combined dataset revealed 1,112 genes upregulated in µ g and 1,429 genes downregulated in µ g ( Supplementary Table 2 ). It should be noted that >99% of DEGs identified as common to the two individual datasets listed above were similarly identified by this combined analysis. Additionally, this analysis further reinforced the enrichment categories initially observed by individual analyses.  Table 2  lists the major enriched GO terms for DEGs up- and downregulated in µ g.\n\nGenes upregulated in μ g, compared to 1 g in space\n\nTranscription factors\n\nSimilar to the individual studies, the combined results for PS and PRR show strong enrichment of genes associated with DNA transcription. In total, 159 Transcription Factors (TFs) as identified by Pruneda-Paz et al. were upregulated in µ g ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The majority of these TFs are involved in regulating shoot meristem and leaf growth and are associated with organ patterning, leaf development, and photomorphogenesis. Specifically, SPCH, WOX3, TCP22, GATA2, HFR1, several GRFs, as well as TFs mediating auxin responses and brassinosteroid (BR) signaling were upregulated in the μ g condition relative to 1 g controls. The upregulated list also included 8 TFs belonging to the Apetala2/Ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) superfamily, of which cytokinin response factors (CRF4 and CRF5) and Aintegumenta (ANT) play established roles in cell proliferation and embryo, cotyledon and leaf development.\n\nOther transcriptional regulators\n\nAmong the DEGs upregulated in μ g, 7 genes with potential epigenetic regulatory function were noted. Of these, 5 genes encoded SET domain containing histone methyltransferases including 3 members of the SUVH family. Genome wide methylation changes leading to altered transcriptional profiles have been reported in response to spaceflight.\n\nAuxin related genes\n\nAnother conserved category that was prominent in the combined analysis is auxin transport and signaling ( Table 3 ); this group includes 2 auxin efflux carriers (PIN3 and PIN4), six auxin response factors (ARFs), and 11 small auxin upregulated (SAUR) genes.\n\nSAURs were among the more highly upregulated genes in µ g, with 9 of the 11 induced more than 2-fold. SAURs were first characterized as rapidly induced in response to auxin, although a few SAURs are repressed by auxin. Of the 11 SAURs identified in this dataset, 10 are induced by auxin; SAUR15 and SAUR16 may also be induced by Gibberellic acid (GA) and Brassinosteroids. SAURs 13-16 are classified as lirSAURs that are light-regulated in cotyledons and hypocotyls and directly interact with phytochrome interacting factors (PIF)s. Overexpression of SAUR36 and SAUR41 increases cell expansion and promotes hypocotyl elongation. SAUR36 is implicated in leaf growth senescence, and SAUR76 may act as a negative regulator of leaf expansion by regulating cell division. SAUR15 is involved in the shade avoidance response and is a potential target of PIF4. Interestingly, SAUR15 expression has been shown to increase on the lower flank of inflorescence stems 30 min following gravistimulation.\n\nWe also detected 6 ARFs upregulated in µ g. In general, ARFs are TFs that are bound by Aux/IAA repressors and remain inactive in the absence of auxin. This repression is relieved in the presence of auxin, promoting transcriptional activation of auxin-responsive downstream genes. Three of the ARFs detected in this dataset (ARF1, ARF4 and ARF19) are implicated in leaf development, while ARF6 and ARF17 play a role in flowering.\n\nVesicle transport genes\n\nInterestingly, the combined analysis of genes enriched in µ g identified a third enriched group –genes involved vesicle-mediated transport– that was not detected in the individual analyses of each experiment. This category consists of approximately 50 genes, including those encoding for members of the coat protein (COP) complex, Sec23/24 protein transport, and several proteins associated with Golgi and the endomembrane system. The enrichment of vesicle transport is consistent with observation that shoot growth and developmental processes appear to be altered under µ g.\n\nNot surprisingly, given the enrichment of biological processes described above involving vesicle transport, auxin responses, and transcriptional regulators, the cellular compartments overrepresented in the µ g upregulated dataset are Golgi and the nucleus ( Table 2 ).\n\nPromoter analysis of genes upregulated in µ g\n\nTo examine whether any cis-regulatory elements may be associated with the genes upregulated in the µ g condition relative to onboard 1 g controls, we analyzed regions upstream of the transcript initiation site using Multiple Expectation maximizations for Motif Elicitation (MEME) software. A consensus sequence, 5’-GGCCCA-3’, was returned as the top result of this query, with an E-value of 3.7E-12 ( Figure 3A ). There were 258 occurrences of this motif in 174 unique genes (15.6% of total input genes). Further, this motif predominantly occurred in the -100 to -0 bp region upstream of transcript initiation sites, as seen in the density analysis ( Figure 3B ). This motif, also known as ‘Up1’’(GGCCCAWWW) or ‘‘Site II element’’ (TGGGCY), is overrepresented in the -200 to -1 bp region of Arabidopsis transcripts. Additionally, this sequence has been identified as a binding site of the TB1, CYCLOIDEA, PCF (TCP) plant-specific family of transcription factors. Arabidopsis TCP proteins regulate many aspects of development including cell cycle control, leaf morphology, senescence as well as defense responses. Consistent with the enrichment of this element upstream of genes upregulated in µ g, a class I TCP (TCP22) was found to be upregulated in µ g ( Supplementary Table 3 ).\n\nGenes downregulated in µ g, compared to 1 g in space\n\nThe combined analysis of PS and PRR indicated that responses to stress (both abiotic and biotic) were highly enriched in genes downregulated in µ g ( Table 2 ), consistent with what was observed in each individual experiment. This overall dampening of stress response genes includes a downregulation of genes encoding several members of Cytochrome P450 family, 14 Glutathione S-transferases, and members of a MATE efflux family involved in detoxification. In addition, we detected an enrichment of plastid-associated genes as well as several involved in cell wall organization.\n\nTranscription factors\n\nThe µ g downregulated DEGs include 120 TFs ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Unlike the upregulated TFs, which were associated with developmental responses, the downregulated TFs are primarily involved in regulating stress responses ( Figure 4 ). The downregulated TFs include those implicated in biotic stress and plant defense and those involved in abiotic stresses, including osmotic and temperature stress. As is illustrated in  Figure 4 , the functions of these downregulated TFs are distinct with limited overlap with those of the upregulated TFs. While 4-5 GO terms show some overlap, these categories are most significant in the downregulated TFs. Further analysis within the overlapping categories show for instance that the auxin and ABA related terms in the upregulated TF group are involved with growth while the downregulated TF genes in these groups contain those that regulate stress as described below.\n\nThe largest groups of TF downregulated in µ g are 15 ethylene response factors (ERF)s and 12 WRKY TFs. The WRKY TFs in our dataset appear to function chiefly in abiotic or biotic stress responses. The ERFs include 7 dehydration responsive element-binding (DREB) subfamily A members including CBF2, and 8 AP2/ERF family TFs. The downregulated TF list also includes 4 heat stress TFs, several MYB and NAC family TFs, and calmodulin binding transcriptional activators (CAMTA)s.\n\nBiotic stress and defense related genes\n\nAmong the genes downregulated in µ g, approximately 200 genes were associated with plant defense and response to biotic stimuli. This category includes 24 disease-resistance proteins, different classes of receptor-like protein kinases, and several WRKY TFs. Of interest, it has been reported that WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY60 (which are represented in our dataset) form a cluster that work either synergistically or antagonistically in response to bacterial or necrotrophic pathogens.\n\nAbiotic stress related genes\n\nIn addition to the downregulation of genes involved in biotic stress responses, we also detected approximately 140 downregulated genes associated with the responses to temperature stimulus and ABA-mediated regulation of osmotic stress ( Supplementary Table 5 ). Song et al. carried out a time series of RNA-Seq experiments and large-scale ChIP-Seq focused on 21 ABA-responsive TFs. This study revealed a TF hierarchical network regulating ABA responses in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, 9 of these 21 TFs (namely, NFY-B2, NFY-C2, GBF3, MYB44, DIV2, HB7, NAC032, NAC102 and RD26) are downregulated in our dataset.\n\nCalcium signaling related genes\n\nGiven the enhancement in stress responses, it is not surprising that approximately 40 genes involved in calcium signaling were downregulated in µ g ( Table 4 ). This category includes calcium binding proteins, calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK)s, calmodulin-binding proteins and TFs, CBL-interacting protein kinases, and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels (CNGC)s.\n\nNon-coding RNAs\n\nNatural antisense transcripts (NAT)s are antisense sequences which may overlap in part with protein coding (sense) transcripts. This sense-antisense pairing can lead to regulation of the sense transcript. A negative correlation in expression (i.e. NAT up and sense transcript down) may be indicative of gene silencing; however, NATs may also enhance sense transcript expression by regulating mRNA stability and/or translation.\n\nAmong the DEGs in µ g, we found 42 upregulated NATs and 30 downregulated NATs. Interestingly, we observe a negative correlation between NAT expression and the overlapping sense transcripts for 29 of the 42 upregulated NATs suggesting a possible means of repression of these genes. Among these are several genes encoding for chloroplastic proteins, defense related proteins and the TF MYB44 ( Supplementary Table 6 ). Additionally, we observed that the expression of 20 of the overlapping sense transcripts for the 30 downregulated NATs are upregulated under µ g ( Supplementary Table 6 ).\n\nMicrogravity versus the space environment\n\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of the DEGs that are downregulated in both PS and PRR is that > 400 genes are associated with stress responses. This included a strong enrichment of biotic stress response (in particular, response to bacteria and chitin) and genes known to respond to many abiotic stresses, including salt and temperature. Curiously, these responses have been reported as upregulated in spaceflight experiments compared to ground controls. It is not surprising that the space environment poses several challenges to plants and many of these are not easy to measure or replicate on the ground. Although our focus in both PS and PRR spaceflights was the direct comparison of µ g with the onboard 1 g control, we also carried out ground controls where EMCS chamber conditions were matched in the ground reference module ERM-2. An examination of the DEGs between 1 g in space and ground controls revealed that many of these stress response-related genes were actually upregulated in 1 g compared to the ground. These observations indicate that the space environment (excluding µ g) enhanced the expression of these stress-related genes. However, this group of genes was specifically downregulated in µ g compared to 1 g suggesting that microgravity masks the induction of these genes in the space environment. Representative heat maps for select defense-related genes are shown in  Figure 5  ( Supplementary Table 7 ). As an example of an abiotic stress response, heat maps for a set of genes involved in salt stress are shown in  Figure 6  ( Supplementary Table 8 ). These heat maps clearly illustrate that the stress-related genes showed higher levels of expression in the spaceflight 1 g condition compared to either µ g or the ground controls. Since the 1 g and µ g experiments were conducted on two rotors held in the same chamber at the same time, we can be confident that all other “space-related” stimuli were shared between the two, and that the primary difference between them was the µ g treatment. The differences between 1 g and the ground control samples, would include all other effects of the space environment, excluding microgravity. It is clear that many of these genes would not have been detected as differentially expressed in the absence of the on board 1 g control and these results reveal that this control is critical in order to identify µ g specific changes.\n\nMicro RNAs detected and their target genes\n\nIn addition to mRNA profiling, the PRR spaceflight experiment included sequencing of small RNAs (sRNA)s which revealed that several micro RNAs (miRNA)s were differentially regulated in µ g compared to 1 g and ground controls. miRNAs act to regulate gene expression either by the cleavage of their target mRNAs, or by repression of translation or DNA methylation.\n\nWe identified 3 miRNAs –miR319c, miR863-5p and miR398b-3p– that were upregulated in µ g ( Figure 7A ). Both miR863 and miR398b are found in Arabidopsis leaves and seedlings. The miR398 family was shown to target Cu++ and Zn++ dismutase enzymes in response to Cu++ deficiency and the miR319 family is involved in the regulation of leaf shape via their interaction with TCP TFs. Although the specific targets listed in these publications were not represented in our dataset, we did detect several putative miRNA targets. Correlation analysis of miR319c and miR863-5p and their predicted mRNA targets detected in our dataset are shown in  Figure 7B  ( Supplementary Table 9 ). It can be seen that many of the predicted targets were coordinately downregulated in µ g, consistent with repression by these miRNAs. The miR319c cluster of downregulated targets include several defense-related genes and 12 of the 22 miR398b-3p target genes encode for chloroplastic enzymes and proteins. Interestingly, overall 38% of the downregulated miR319c, miR863-5p and miR398b-3p target gene products are localized in the plastid.\n\nTwo miRNAs, miR156f-3p and miR5654-3p were upregulated in 1 g relative to µ g ( Figure 7A ) with coordinate down regulation of 14-16 of their predicted targets in 1 g ( Supplementary Table 9 ). The miR156 family is closely associated with and regulates several Squamosa Promoter binding Like (SPL) TFs and is important for regulating phase transitions such as the progression from juvenile to adult stages and flowering time. Most recently, miR156 has been shown to modulate seedling growth in response to temperature and light changes via its interaction with SPL9. Coincidentally, SPL9 expression is downregulated in 1 g in our dataset along with other targets of miR156f-3p, which are related to auxin and ethylene signaling.\n\nWe also observed that both µ g and 1 g seedlings had higher expression of miR398b-3p compared to ground control and 4 miR398b-3p target genes were coordinately downregulated in both µ g and 1 g compared with ground, including two TFs, GTE11 and ATRX-like-protein.\n\nDay 4 versus day 6: a possible interaction between µ g responses and development\n\nThe experimental design of PRR with staggered hydration allowed for some samples to be initiated 48h later, yielding two time points (Day 4 and Day 6) from the same experiment. Our major focus was on DEGs detected at Day 6, described in the preceding sections. Comparing the effects of microgravity on the Day 4 and Day 6 plants revealed interactions between plant developmental stage and microgravity. These interactions are apparent in the PCA plot of the PRR Day 4 and 6 flight samples ( Figure 8A ). Principal component 1 primarily separated Day 4 and Day 6 samples under 1 g (p<0.05). Principal component 2 separated 1 g and µ g at either day (p<0.001). However, there was little separation between the Day 4 and Day 6 samples in µ g in the first principal component ( Figure 8A ).\n\nExamination of the DEGs at Day 4 revealed that a much smaller fraction of genes were differentially regulated in µ g at Day 4 (compared with the DEGs detected at Day 6). In total, at Day 4 there were 406 DEGs (75 up and 331 down in µ g compared to 1 g). Many of these DEGs (~ 40% of the up- and 60% of downregulated genes in µ g) at Day 4 were shared with the Day 6 data. A majority of the 210 genes commonly downregulated in µ g at both Day 4 and Day 6, were related to abiotic and biotic stresses as described previously. This finding indicates that µ g specific downregulation of stress responses occurs as early as Day 4 and is common between the two times sampled. Genes associated with cell wall organization were also found to be downregulated at both days. Examples of genes which exhibit similar downregulation in microgravity at both Day 4 and 6 are depicted in  Figure 8B .\n\nWe also observed that several genes were uniquely downregulated in µ g at Day 4 only. Scatter plots of representative genes in this group clearly indicate that the differential expression observed at Day 4 did not persist at Day 6 ( Figure 8C ).\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that the developmental window the samples are in could influence the observed transcription response profiles and point to interactions between µ g and the developmental stage.",
